and of course , we all share the same adaptive imper@@ atives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ orable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the Earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
the ethn@@ osphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an aston@@ ish@@ ingly inqu@@ isi@@ tive species .
and just as the biosphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the ethn@@ osphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
and the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of gram@@ ma@@ tical rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an old @-@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be envel@@ op@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dread@@ ful fate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and carries with him into the grave the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient tongue .
let &apos;s make it Ko@@ gi . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethn@@ osphere , a brief journey through the ethn@@ osphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that myth@@ ologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic ex@@ og@@ amy : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and this is all rooted in the myth@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Wa@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ astern Ecu@@ ador , an astonishing people first cont@@ acted peac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 1957 , five mission@@ aries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ sy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , for@@ getting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two @-@ dimensional in their lives .
but the Wa@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they sp@@ ear@@ ed each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ acious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . and V@@ oo@@ doo is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaph@@ ysi@@ cal worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Chris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Islam , Buddhism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
but , what makes V@@ oo@@ doo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spiri@@ ts .
that &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
we dance in the temple and become God . &quot;
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Ko@@ gi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Colom@@ bia .
in a blood@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the Spanish .
to this day , they remain rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ thood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ thood is rather extraordinary .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &quot;
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
well , indigenous people are neither sentim@@ ental nor weak@@ ened by nostal@@ gia .
now , what does that mean ?
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph I took in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon just last April .
this is ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active preparation of the sham@@ an &apos;s re@@ pertoire .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ otonin , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine , 5 @-@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blowing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ oses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine .
to have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ fle barrel lined with b@@ aro@@ que paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create the distor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ amine ox@@ id@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the M@@ AO .
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is exposed to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot;
well , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Co@@ fan , has 17 varieties of ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establish their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and I said , &quot; No . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stam@@ ens .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bug@@ gy .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integrity of the ethn@@ osphere . it is power , the crude face of dom@@ ination .
or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political dom@@ ination .
and you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ chen Lama .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese inv@@ asion .
his uncle fl@@ ed with H@@ is Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ aspora that took the people to Nepal .
his mother was incar@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being wealthy .
he was s@@ mug@@ gled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her sk@@ irt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that brave de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently stepped on an arm@@ band of Mao , and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to behold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ ro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ ch@@ ro@@ matic world of diversity ?
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the en@@ su@@ ing millennia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
the Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sover@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ lements .
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
the family , fear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wrapped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hide .
so , this man &apos;s grandfather was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blowing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and defe@@ c@@ ated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
he put a spray of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally fro@@ ze solid , he but@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
the Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent territory . they control all min@@ eral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation @-@ state can seek res@@ titu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ an@@ ds of somebody .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
thank you very much .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gig@@ abytes of digital photos here and kind of seam@@ lessly and continuously zo@@ oming in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ arran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non @-@ image data .
this is &quot; ble@@ ak House &quot; by D@@ ickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e @-@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of The Guardian .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi @-@ scale kind of medium .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian .
we &apos;ve made up a fake ad that &apos;s very high resolution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve embedded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fications .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
we hope that this means no more pop @-@ ups and other kind of rub@@ b@@ ish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the U.S.
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a NASA ge@@ osp@@ ati@@ al image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called Photosyn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Sn@@ av@@ ely , a graduate student at the University of Washington , co @-@ advis@@ ed by Steve Sei@@ tz at U.@@ W.
and Rick S@@ zel@@ is@@ ki at Microsoft Research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the Web . it &apos;s powered by Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi @-@ resolution experience .
but the spatial arran@@ gement of the images here is actually meaningful .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
and so these are all Flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spati@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
you know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at Microsoft .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of rec@@ eption here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ Rs , quite a large number of them , s@@ tit@@ ched together in this environment .
and if I can , I &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a poster of No@@ tr@@ e Dame that registered correctly .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visually , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emerges of the entire Earth .
think of this as the long tail to Stephen La@@ w@@ ler &apos;s Virtual Earth work .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tagged with met@@ a @-@ data that somebody else entered .
and of course , a by @-@ product of all of that is immen@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do I understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in p@@ hr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
B@@ la@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ grat@@ ulations .
thanks so much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ onate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; official dog@@ ma . &quot;
the official dog@@ ma of what ?
the official dog@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the official dog@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worthwhile , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
the way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
this , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ ressing .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
we can construct six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communications .
there was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a Bell .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; No . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B.
a has these benefits , and these risks .
B has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; Doc , what should I do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; If you were me , Doc , what would you do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
there &apos;s enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescri@@ ptions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
we don &apos;t inher@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re @-@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occupied , asking themselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I get married or not ? should I get married now ?
should I get married later ? should I have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are consuming questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are blessed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Rand@@ ol@@ ph Hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the Wi@@ Fi works .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Black@@ berry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our l@@ aps .
and even if they &apos;re all shut off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
should I respond to this email ? should I d@@ raft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soccer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradox@@ ically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from van@@ guard , the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the emplo@@ yer offered , rate of participation went down two percent .
you offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
by not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happily match their contribution .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
and I think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ tern@@ ity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ ressing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chose .
second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t New Yor@@ kers , I apologize .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the Hamp@@ tons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , damn it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s August .
everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
I could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and he spends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choosing one thing , you &apos;re choosing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attractive .
third : escal@@ ation of expectations .
this hit me when I went to replace my je@@ ans .
I wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
so I went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and I said , you know , &quot; I want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ eper said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , relax@@ ed fit ?
you want button fly or zi@@ pper fly ? you want st@@ on@@ e@@ washed or acid @-@ washed ?
do you want them dis@@ tr@@ essed ?
you want boot cut , you want tap@@ ered , blah blah blah ... &quot; On and on he went .
my jaw dropped , and after I recovered , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these damn je@@ ans , and I walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the best @-@ fitting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but I felt worse .
why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vors , damn it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was disap@@ pointing in comparison to what I expected .
adding options to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
I want to say -- just a little autobi@@ ograph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t settle .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is disap@@ pointing , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ; they blame themselves .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objec@@ tively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dog@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all false . it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
now , as a policy matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , Western societies .
and what is so frustrating and in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating is this : Steve Lev@@ itt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult @-@ to @-@ install child seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what I &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
this is what economists call a &quot; Par@@ e@@ to @-@ improving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice pl@@ ag@@ ues us .
so to conclude . you &apos;re supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , &quot; Ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bowl . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
the more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ atter the f@@ ish@@ bowl so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you sh@@ atter this f@@ ish@@ bowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
everybody needs a f@@ ish@@ bowl .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the absence of some metaphor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bowl is a recipe for misery , and , I suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digi@@ tizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthes@@ izing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various approaches , par@@ ing it down to minimal components .
we &apos;ve been digi@@ tizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
we &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthes@@ ize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthes@@ ize a chromosome ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our pace of digi@@ tizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthes@@ izing DNA is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of p@@ hi X@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
they laughed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ encing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overl@@ ap with all the other 50 @-@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ units we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ marks in .
think of this : we have a four @-@ letter genetic code -- A , C , G and T.
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was au@@ t@@ ograph it .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4,000 @-@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a basketball play@@ off .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adily in E. coli -- it exhau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ coc@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
this is not an electron micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a six @-@ second period .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 80,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we printed it out at a 10 f@@ ont with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ oning .
with bacteria and Ar@@ chae@@ a , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
there are enzymes called restri@@ ction enzymes that actually di@@ gest DNA .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transfer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
now I &apos;ve argued , this is not gen@@ esis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and I &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : I was born in 19@@ 46 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 19@@ 46 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion @-@ plus barrels of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ atori@@ al genomics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharmaceu@@ ticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard selection : we can select for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen snap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re focusing on now fourth @-@ generation fuels .
you &apos;ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and third @-@ generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher @-@ value fuels like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth @-@ generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling @-@ water temperatures .
it takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petro@@ l @-@ chemical industry -- Yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ atori@@ al vaccines in advance .
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Ar@@ chae@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes .
we &apos;re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
this is the machine below Gen@@ eva .
we take the pictures of those mini @-@ Big Ban@@ gs inside dete@@ ctors .
this is the one I work on . it &apos;s called the AT@@ L@@ A@@ S detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
spectacular picture here of AT@@ L@@ A@@ S under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by AT@@ L@@ A@@ S .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colli@@ ding with a piece of the LHC deliber@@ ately , and show@@ ering particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw that picture on September 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ umph .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires .
those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wires . &quot;
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conducting wire .
so at minus 2@@ 71 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ ints between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ nets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defe@@ ct .
so the wire heated up slightly , and its 13@@ ,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those mag@@ nets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damaged about 50 of the mag@@ nets .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fixed them .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
by the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents reig@@ ni@@ te the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to refu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
thank you .
I am a writer .
writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it is also my great lifel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
the result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I &apos;m do@@ omed .
seriously -- do@@ omed , do@@ omed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all , ever again ? &quot;
so that &apos;s reass@@ uring , you know .
and people would say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the humili@@ ation of reje@@ ction will kill you ?
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and I always have been .
and I &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
like sea@@ weed , and other things that are scary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block John , how &apos;s it going ?
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alco@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic @-@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
and all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally commit suicide seem to be really und@@ one by their gifts , you know .
Norman ma@@ iler , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; E@@ very one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assumption .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
and I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpet@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that I &apos;m in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it &apos;s exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh , so Jesus , what a thought !
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , O.K. ?
people believed that creativity was this divine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and un@@ know@@ able source , for distant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
the Greeks famously called these divine atten@@ d@@ ant spiri@@ ts of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
So@@ cr@@ ates , famously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
the Rom@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ embodied creative spirit a genius .
which is great , because the Rom@@ ans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ embodied genius who had helped you .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of l@@ ame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to sw@@ allow the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and distor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expectations about performance .
and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspic@@ ions about the notion of , basically fai@@ ries who follow people around rub@@ bing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter mad@@ dening cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave ration@@ ally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right paran@@ or@@ mal .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
and then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was trans@@ cri@@ bing on the page .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
so when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pipeline !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awk@@ war@@ dly .
but even I , in my mul@@ ish@@ ness , even I have br@@ ushed up against that thing , at times .
and I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
and for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom wa@@ its , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in Los Angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape rec@@ order .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then I &apos;m going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and instead of pan@@ icking , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
go bother Leon@@ ard Cohen . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
it could be this peculiar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom .
so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and it already saved me once .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and I started to think I should just dump this project .
but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
so I just lifted my face up from the manus@@ cript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
and I said al@@ oud , &quot; Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
O.K. But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa , people used to gather for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
and they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ formers would actually become transcen@@ dent .
and I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 nights before , but everything would al@@ ign .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to chant , &quot; All@@ ah , All@@ ah , All@@ ah , God , God , God . &quot;
that &apos;s God , you know .
in Spain , when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic , &quot; All@@ ah , ole , ole , All@@ ah , magnificent , Bra@@ vo , &quot; in@@ comprehen@@ sible , there it is -- a glimpse of God .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he w@@ akes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ cend to that height again .
and maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most painful reconci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some un@@ imaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and what I have to , sort of keep telling myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the divine , cock@@ eyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be glimp@@ sed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &quot; O@@ le ! &quot;
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and &quot; O@@ le ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
&quot; O@@ le ! &quot; to you , nonetheless , just for having the sheer human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
O@@ le !
last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the ar@@ ctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shr@@ unk by 40 percent .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ic@@ kness of the ice .
the ar@@ ctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
it expands in winter and contrac@@ ts in summer .
the next slide I show you will be a rapid fast @-@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it contrac@@ ts in summer .
the so @-@ called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ illing out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
already in some shallow l@@ akes in Alaska , methane is actively bub@@ bling up out of the water .
professor Kat@@ ey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
Whoa !
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink he@@ ats up Greenland from the north .
this is an annual melting river .
but the volum@@ es are much larger than ever .
this is the Kan@@ ger@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q River in sou@@ thwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land @-@ base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west Antarctica cro@@ pped up on top some under @-@ sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new l@@ akes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
in the An@@ des , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flows have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snow@@ pack .
this is hitting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americ@@ as , extending west@@ ward , and on either side of the Indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical deple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the United States is one of the two largest emit@@ ters , along with China .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image reminded me of something .
around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ illed .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christmas was this one .
Fr@@ os@@ ty the coal man is a j@@ olly , happy soul .
he &apos;s abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
Fr@@ os@@ ty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
he &apos;s affordable and ad@@ orable , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of Mas@@ sey Co@@ al .
let me be clear about it . Al Gore , Nancy P@@ el@@ os@@ i , Harry Rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the Al@@ liance for Cli@@ mate Prote@@ ction has launched two campaigns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at CO@@ AL@@ ergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art clean coal facility .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
America is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
Re@@ power America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
Re@@ power America . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing America .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investments to create high @-@ paying jobs .
Re@@ power America . it &apos;s time to get real .
there is an old African pro@@ verb that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spatial relationships .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Si@@ ft@@ ables .
in a nu@@ t@@ shell , a Si@@ ft@@ able is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and gras@@ ping .
and Si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
so , I &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if I ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if I ti@@ lt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
so if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here I &apos;m -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mas@@ h @-@ up between Scr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ gle .
basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; Make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
that &apos;s our youngest bet@@ a tes@@ ter , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the Si@@ ft@@ ables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is Fel@@ ix , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the Si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he &apos;s brought a trac@@ tor into the scene .
the orange trac@@ tor .
good job ! yeah !
so by shaking the Si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Wo@@ of !
inventing his own narrative .
hello !
it &apos;s an open @-@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ folds .
fly away , cat .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and you inject it by just b@@ ump@@ ing up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence Si@@ ft@@ able .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
you attach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to adjust it .
and then , overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence Si@@ ft@@ ables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now I put a b@@ ass line in .
now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
and now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the dru@@ ms , so I can control the effect live .
I can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
I can re@@ arrange the sequence while it plays .
so I don &apos;t have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
and now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Si@@ ft@@ able , til@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human @-@ computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the cus@@ p of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
yes , hello .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
yes , so , what is bi@@ oh@@ acking ?
I &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bi@@ oh@@ acking deals with modern molecular biology .
I study molecular biology and have been doing research into bi@@ oh@@ acking for a few years now , I started doing this because I simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what I &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
so it was curiosity and I somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
I think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
there are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields .
now there &apos;s Craig Venter in the USA who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ dies@@ el fuel made from algae .
and the list can go on forever .
and So because of my interest in the in this technology , I went del@@ ved into it more .
so what Why hacking ?
most of us know M@@ ost people have heard of this in the context of software .
computer hacking , and then in the media it &apos;s Yes , hackers break into a place and steal data and so on .
that &apos;s rather sad for the h@@ acker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
software hackers started building computers in the se@@ venti@@ es and eigh@@ ties and this gave rise to the Internet .
and it deals with problem @-@ solving in a playful , creative , original way .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ k@@ erer scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also hack into it , that &apos;s it , and I thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and I just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
there &apos;s h@@ ack@@ teria dot or@@ g , which originally comes from Switzerland , and it &apos;s a network based in Europe with a cooperation in India , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
but the point is to always find a a really loose approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully .
and then there &apos;s do @-@ it @-@ yourself @-@ bio@@ - dot @-@ or@@ g , DI@@ Y bio .
that &apos;s a network from the USA , that &apos;s more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which I &apos;d like to briefly describe .
this picture on the left is of Bi@@ oc@@ ur@@ ious , that &apos;s a h@@ ack@@ er@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non @-@ profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to .
children , elderly people , all sorts of people go there to simply examine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto@@ col@@ s .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in Indonesia , House of Natural fibers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes , also electronic tin@@ k@@ ering , and combine this in a very out@@ land@@ ish way .
and in this other image at the top I have a lecture in in Copenhagen at the Medical Mus@@ ei@@ on in combination with an exhibition on the topic .
and That &apos;s , well That &apos;s These are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fascin@@ ation with technology .
and what you can do with it and approaching society very targe@@ tedly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , okay , to hack into biology , you need material .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely distant ones , for professional staff , trained academics with a doctor &apos;s degree etc. only .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a soup gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and what what are our values and what are what are our objec@@ tives , our fundamental principles ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct .
that was really intuitive , I mean , everyone expressed their wishes , their and things that move them .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
and that was then It &apos;s not bin@@ ding , but it &apos;s yes , I think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
so I think we from the bi@@ oh@@ acker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academic world .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
a project I set up myself with the Hack@@ teria network in Switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so @-@ called optical trap or optical t@@ wee@@ z@@ ers .
you can see this at the bottom .
and then we took apart a DVD bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
another project , that came from from the French group in Paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an EEG or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his nic@@ kn@@ ame is Sam Neuro@@ hack .
he then made this this this helmet , and it took place in in cooperation with the museum .
vis@@ itors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the room@@ went switched on .
was a very a very fancy project .
another thing from the USA that also had to do with pat@@ ern@@ ity test thing , is the the PC@@ R , the poly@@ mer@@ ase Cha@@ in Re@@ action , a complicated term .
this is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , DNA , fragments , so that you can make them visible .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand eu@@ ros at the least .
and that &apos;s not within the range of amateurs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so that &apos;s just one application among many that you can use .
I think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s That &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
a project I recently started was the building of a gene gun .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which shoo@@ ts about this far , two cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res or so .
you charge gold particles with DNA and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then I shot at on@@ ions and made them light up and stuff like that .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
then I took a whi@@ pped cream dis@@ pen@@ ser and connected it to that .
a whi@@ pped cream dis@@ pen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , I think about forty to six@@ ty bar .
and with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the on@@ ions .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ teen thousand eu@@ ros or so , whereas whi@@ pped cream dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers cost about fifty eu@@ ros .
so the It &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically do@@ able .
so that &apos;s currently the the core objective of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and comprehen@@ si@@ bility , so that that more people can get involved .
because as I said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it .
because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
and I think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and And you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and this tra@@ des under the names Open Kn@@ ow@@ le@@ dge and C@@ iti@@ zen Science .
so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concern of of bi@@ oh@@ ackers .
those are the people who are at least offici@@ ally registered on the website , the DI@@ Y @-@ bio @-@ dot @-@ or@@ g @-@ website .
there &apos;s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represented in South @-@ East @-@ Asia .
that is I think they are L@@ ess people have registered than actually exist .
I know of some people who haven &apos;t registered .
and they are just the bi@@ oh@@ ackers , individuals .
some of them are also registered together with the h@@ ack@@ er@@ spaces , those places .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
like I said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
and h@@ ack@@ er@@ spaces , so computer h@@ ack@@ er@@ spaces , C @-@ base in Berlin was the first , in nin@@ et@@ een ninety @-@ five .
and that &apos;s become a gigantic network of very good , well , infrastructure centr@@ es , which are being represented all over the world .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll expand in a similar way and also be similarly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
and I would like to invite everyone to work on it and event try something yourselves .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
thanks for listening .
that was all .
yes , hello .
how do we humans actually function ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible .
so what are ar@@ cha@@ ic models ?
I wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
ar@@ cha@@ ic models are models that we adopted in pre @-@ industrial times .
intrinsic to these ar@@ cha@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality .
that might sound unusual at first .
I will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality .
and the second aspect is that since we because of these ar@@ cha@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a codi@@ fied language today .
and the third area speaks for itself really .
we all know that interactive media is , by definition , non @-@ linear , which involves the neg@@ ation of linear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider linear@@ ity normal today .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
I would like to prove that to you .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
we You wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many doors there are .
that is exactly what you are doing .
you are virtu@@ alis@@ ing the reality without a computer .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
at the media campus , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and this this ability to virtu@@ alis@@ e the virtual reality was something that people in pre @-@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
and they didn &apos;t have photo@@ li@@ th@@ ography .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their mind .
and in this mind they had memory .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and that &apos;s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality .
the interesting thing about this is that I can make a short trip .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
what is the media today ?
you will notice that a change has taken place .
but I &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
a crucial tool in information bro@@ ker@@ age has always been stories .
Sh@@ am@@ ans , pri@@ ests , so @-@ called keepers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally assigned to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
according to the author of the book The storytelling Anim@@ al , Jonathan Gott@@ sch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the rec@@ eption of stories .
that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life receiving stories .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre @-@ industrial cultures .
what is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we &apos;ve anch@@ ored the ability to think in a non @-@ linear way in our biological memory .
I brought along an example of the North American tribe of the No@@ ot@@ ka Indians .
they live lived in the coastal region of British Columbia .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and they did this using so @-@ called lead maps .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the Australian abor@@ ig@@ in@@ als .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so @-@ called son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ am@@ paths
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ gation and the top@@ ography of regions could be depic@@ ted through songs .
and for them language had inferi@@ or importance .
that means they navi@@ gated through the use of sound and rhythm .
why do we no longer sing to get from A to B from above ?
at least not to navigate .
what What happened there ?
what happened is the the so @-@ called machine age .
before this , we were in the so @-@ called age of feu@@ d@@ alism .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photo@@ li@@ th@@ ography .
and what happened is that we transfer@@ red the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media .
to the book and to the image .
the consequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtu@@ alis@@ e .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien to us
let &apos;s make a short provis@@ ion@@ al app@@ rais@@ al .
from the age of feu@@ d@@ alism to the to the machine age .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
those are the declining influences of the pre @-@ industrial cultures .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standar@@ dis@@ ed , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
we no longer produce .
we have an abstract an abstr@@ acted language .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codi@@ fy them through language .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion .
and we &apos;ve accepted linear@@ ity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non @-@ linear@@ ity .
what &apos;s left is storytelling .
we &apos;re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information bro@@ ker@@ age .
the question is , what will come next ?
we had the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so @-@ called cyber age .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fiction , I know .
but the concepts of the cyber age , they are returning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non @-@ linear@@ ity , about storytelling .
I &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
another example is so @-@ called virtual reality As crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non @-@ exis@@ tent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ deck .
and other A@@ no@@ ther example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligent@@ ly .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
I brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these ar@@ cha@@ ic , cognitive models are being addressed again .
the whole thing is a game , I must add .
which of course very much accom@@ mod@@ ates for storytelling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when I say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imagining a number of person@@ s people jumping around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ sole .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
this is a game for outside .
and it was expres@@ s@@ ly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to re@@ discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
I &apos;m sorry I have to keep this so short .
you can explain this much more elabor@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
the point of the game is that I discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or neg@@ atively on Twitter .
and so I can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because I see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can take a look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
thank you .
yes , I &apos;m very happy to be here .
I was just asked whether this sack is a talking sack and will talk for me .
it won &apos;t .
I &apos;ll be revealing what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
but for now I &apos;ll just keep up the suspen@@ se .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
I &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course I deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besides your existence as a designer .
when professors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ mes@@ ter .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
a research se@@ mes@@ ter on the topic Natural user Interface Design .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , ar@@ cha@@ ic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc .
so I looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so if we look at the development of our society , summar@@ ised briefly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
from the modern to the computer society .
each society is character@@ ised by one primary medium .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , character@@ ised by language .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same cave or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and relatively naturally .
that was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstr@@ action .
depending on how and when I car@@ ve , a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
but gradually the written form became the primary medium , and gained a fo@@ oth@@ old .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still primarily at .
that &apos;s the medium of print with Gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , fac@@ eb@@ ook etc .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanisms , principles and ar@@ cha@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tribal society .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
not , if I am environmentally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environmentally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
we &apos;re accum@@ ulating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re accum@@ ulating it increasingly qu@@ icker and better , for example .
just like it used to happen in the village .
against that background I looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten , and what is instinc@@ tive for us , so what difference does it make ?
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
so you have to examine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be improved too .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and percep@@ tual psychology .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ?
like Steve Jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friendly or intui@@ tively man@@ age@@ able , and what does that mean fundamentally .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
and just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but I have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that I know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally man@@ age@@ able as possible .
and of course how design affects perception .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a container , I can directly see which one contains salt and which one contains pe@@ pper .
and if I say to someone , pass me the salt or the pe@@ pper , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively grab it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
but our perception , how it dec@@ ei@@ ves us too .
for example perception in this context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equally big , and yet our perception changes , depending on the context we place things in .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should also work .
here Here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ relate or associate a certain simil@@ arity .
this is called a law of design or Gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
the law of pro@@ xim@@ ity , the law of of continuity , etc .
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
but it &apos;s an essential component , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
that might sound mund@@ ane at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
that &apos;s wrong .
first you see from back to front .
because you project an assumption that you &apos;re seeing something you rec@@ og@@ nis@@ e to the front , such as a circle .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
I have this cognitive feedback , you projected something you want to see .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the span of m@@ illis@@ econds in which these things happen .
I don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
the same thing that I just described is now happening .
everybody is now trying to rec@@ og@@ nis@@ e something in this pattern .
I don &apos;t know who rec@@ og@@ nis@@ es what .
does anyone see anything specific ?
a Dal@@ ma@@ tian , exactly .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a Dal@@ ma@@ tian in this , you know it .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because I &apos;m showing where the Dal@@ ma@@ tian is .
now you see the Dal@@ ma@@ tian .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
and that &apos;s the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing .
now I know it and project the fact that I &apos;m seeing a Dal@@ ma@@ tian to the front .
then I see the Dal@@ ma@@ tian .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this rose @-@ tin@@ ted area .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
a long time , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if I know something takes three seconds , until I slide from the present into the past so to speak , then I am well capable of bri@@ dging waiting times , in that he in that I keep someone occupied for three seconds .
he will have to process that as the present .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , I can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegant way , if I know this phenomenon .
what takes twenty @-@ five m@@ illis@@ econds ?
yes , m@@ illis@@ econds .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because I will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and six@@ teen m@@ illis@@ econds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have .
that means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ d@@ ingly .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive erg@@ on@@ omics , but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects .
there are indic@@ ator functions , where I know exactly where I have to look .
but there are also symbolic functions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous sums of money on such a little bag that you can hardly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
we &apos;re more on the symbolic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occupied with .
going back to my actual topic Natural user Interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
us@@ ability always means how can I reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisfying way possible .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can I make something as user friendly as possible ?
can I handle it directly or do I need a manual or a correspon@@ dent training .
and then it &apos;s less usable or user friendly .
making it differently or pre@@ t@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
intuitive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when Apple appeared on the scene , if I wanted to make technological devices usable for people .
why ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user interfaces .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
but what I want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cryp@@ tic codes , but a metaphor .
that made the whole thing consider@@ ably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more .
so , as a designer , I design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appearance .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that I can suddenly That the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an application .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ?
if they become more intuitive and then I have to rough @-@ handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive erg@@ on@@ omics , when is something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s For us humans , something is intuitive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
so apparently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
the less I think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then I can make use of that as a designer .
that means I can transfer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consider@@ ably more user friendly .
that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now I &apos;ve already given it away .
it &apos;s the so @-@ called O@@ S@@ IT model .
we all use it , and O@@ S@@ IT is an acr@@ ony@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , select , inform , trans@@ act .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consciously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instinc@@ tively in part .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
O@@ S@@ IT in itself is used by us fifty to se@@ v@@ enty thousand times depending on the activity , it was as@@ certain@@ ed that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
I can transfer this performance model ori@@ ent , select , inform , trans@@ act to an interaction system .
and this kind of transfer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the transfer@@ al of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop .
and then I can transfer the whole thing .
I &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
over@@ view : I &apos;m interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in .
I get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
and suddenly I have an interface that is consider@@ ably more intuitive and natural .
I &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ duce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteristic that can &apos;t be learned .
my objective is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , forty years of The @-@ Club @-@ of @-@ Rome , into quality .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
give pe@@ e a chance .
every day you release + you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
we &apos;d only be able to float in the earth &apos;s seas as am@@ orph@@ ous m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absorb and release phosphorus .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we are dependent on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already em@@ itting a lot more ur@@ anium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last twenty years alone , fif@@ teen thousand ton@@ nes of ur@@ anium was put onto our fields in Germany .
and we absorb all of it .
it causes leu@@ k@@ emia in children .
and we think we &apos;re protecting the environment when we do a little less damage .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
protect the environment , produce less rub@@ b@@ ish .
protect the environment , consume less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ dle to the grave , then our our entire planet will become a c@@ em@@ eter@@ y sooner or later .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ dle to cra@@ dle .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the ground stores over six@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
at the moment we &apos;re growing corn and losing between el@@ even and thirty kil@@ ograms thirty ton@@ nes per he@@ ct@@ are , if you were to calculate it per square met@@ re .
that means we &apos;re losing five @-@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
in Offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of n@@ app@@ ies .
and as we get older , the n@@ app@@ ies get bigger .
+ That is They &apos;re all in the pre @-@ n@@ appy stage , so to speak .
right ?
one A baby needs about six @-@ thousand n@@ app@@ ies .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
China can make up for that in one second .
it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant .
so the question is , how should we deal with n@@ app@@ ies ?
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
I &apos;d like to tell you why .
because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components fa@@ ec@@ es .
with people , it is released in the ur@@ ine .
yes .
so humans can &apos;t be pigs .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
traditionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and if you deny people the if you deny people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and hostile .
and so you have someone like Al Gore , one of our great heroes , saying : there is nothing more important than stabil@@ ising the human population .
in Israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants weigh four times as much a people .
I could also mention ter@@ mites , but in the USA nobody likes ter@@ mites , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arians .
so ants weigh more than we do .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
you can only be climate neutral if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
that &apos;s your only chance .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
have you ?
just one single one ?
that means our entire intelligence amounts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you see ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
thank@@ fully , right ?
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the Amazon For@@ est alone .
of those Have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dum@@ ber than trees .
and then you see that even something like Dem@@ eter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned .
every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosphorus , which should really be circul@@ ated .
and so there are too many of us .
just because of that .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
but where are we of use ?
we try to minim@@ ize our ecological footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that &apos;s of use .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
zero emissions , you see ?
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can win back our nutrients .
with the agriculture we practice in Brazil in which we win back nutrients .
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
we do it in China for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
in In China a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
and in our Western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients .
this means that the entire history of Western civilization is character@@ ized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places .
that &apos;s why all Western emp@@ ires just kept on expanding until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imp@@ lo@@ ded .
you see ?
it was different in China .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutrients .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in China , people expect you to stay on after the meal until you need to use the toilet .
because it &apos;s un@@ friendly to go and take the nutrients with you .
you were You were invited to dinner , not to steal nutrients .
that means you can see how to win back nutrients on the Internet .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ velas goes down by over ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
that &apos;s high @-@ tech agriculture of course , but the p@@ lots take care of themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and none of these p@@ lots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years , none of these p@@ lots was every sab@@ ot@@ aged .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ tr@@ e of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ru@@ ined for years .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in Germany the most su@@ itable pur@@ i@@ fication plant is the one in Frank@@ fur@@ t .
unfortunately not the one on Offen@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the Frank@@ fur@@ ters a hand .
because the plant in Frank@@ fur@@ t would be the best at winning back phosphorus .
and it must go back .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see that it can be done .
in Holland we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
the Dutch government has stated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphorus .
but we need this everywhere .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ v@@ enty percent of the phosphorus reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide .
there &apos;s the OPEC , a a bunch of amateurs .
it consists of twenty @-@ six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil depos@@ its .
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
so it &apos;s about effec@@ tivity , not efficiency .
in Holland it &apos;s easier to understand this , because Holland built the country on flowers .
you see ?
imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty ros@@ es .
totally in@@ efficient .
but totally effective , right ?
or take lip@@ stick .
a woman in Germany sw@@ allows about six point three kilos of lip@@ stick in her lifetime .
whereas .
and that scientifically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is kis@@ sed away .
but I can tell you , even in this light , that lip@@ stick is totally in@@ efficient , but very effective , you see ?
a All the beautiful things in life are in@@ efficient .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effec@@ tivity .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
not burning the bi@@ os@@ oli@@ ds a little more , stor@@ ing them and losing all the materials for the cycles in the inc@@ iner@@ ation plant , but asking on@@ es@@ elf , how do you close cycles ?
imagine Mozart being efficient .
right ?
if I invite you over for dinner and I say : yes , we &apos;re having a pill with Offen@@ b@@ ach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoi@@ ding , reducing .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the South are not environmentally aware .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
to what We &apos;re thinking from a Northern perspective .
every footprint is dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ geous there .
when you go running , right , every footprint destro@@ ys the ground .
because the soil will the m@@ oss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
but if you &apos;re in Italy , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wet@@ land .
not guilt management .
we say sustainability in Germany .
right ?
but if I would ask you , how is your wife ?
what would you say ?
sustainable .
then I would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
that &apos;s just about the minimum .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avoi@@ ding .
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in Italy throw out a can of Coca @-@ Cola from their car window .
that &apos;s a funny occurr@@ ence , you know .
it &apos;s a type of terri@@ torial behavior , right ?
you can show that you were there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cream wr@@ apping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ degraded , wherever it is .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
so two cycles are created .
of course not everything should be compos@@ table .
a TV or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe sol@@ es , bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings , car ty@@ res , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
right ?
let &apos;s take sne@@ akers for example , right ?
direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company P@@ U@@ MA , but to help this company make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t We no longer make things free of stuff .
right ?
so if I invite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
posi@@ tively .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
there &apos;s nothing pois@@ on@@ ous in it .
everything that &apos;s inside can be utiliz@@ ed .
these are the first shoes with which you make a j@@ ack@@ rab@@ bit start at the pedestri@@ an lights and the rubber sole can go into biological cycles , okay ?
it &apos;s all compos@@ table all of it .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for Adi@@ das , for Nike , for H@@ enn@@ es and Mauri@@ tz and the whole textile industry .
and half of the waste@@ water problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
Hey , P@@ U@@ MA , do you are you really serious ?
because they changed their ch@@ air@@ man of the board of direc@@ tors twice now .
and I &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
so give me a hand here .
it is possible though .
yes .
that which I just presented to you .
it &apos;s possible .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles .
there are also technical cycles .
there &apos;s the a direct returning system for this .
it &apos;s the first biological ru@@ ck@@ sack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
if you think about it , right ?
remember those n@@ app@@ ies again ?
if At the moment they &apos;re waste .
these n@@ app@@ ies are everywhere practically .
in those countries where people have money .
they &apos;re on the rub@@ b@@ ish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ?
right ?
if you just take these these n@@ app@@ ies , sh@@ red them , steri@@ li@@ ze them and take the powder to plant trees with it .
that makes the baby carbon @-@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neutral , we can be climate @-@ positive .
it &apos;s about making a beneficial po@@ op print .
yes , so to speak .
right ?
we can do that .
we can re @-@ invent things all over again .
I founded an institute with this in mind .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s also an extra association , the Cra@@ dle @-@ to @-@ Cra@@ dle @-@ Institute , where everybody can get involved .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avoi@@ ding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste .
does that make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
music as language .
in the description of my presentation , it is written that I , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a translator , in the English sense of the word .
interpre@@ ters are transl@@ ators of the written notes in res@@ o@@ unding music .
translating from German into English can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the translation of literature or even poetry .
what we musicians do with our musical language is very alien to non @-@ professionals .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music I only have the musical notes at first .
now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they &apos;ve thought of .
in reality the notes are very v@@ ague and im@@ precise .
these notes are about as precise or im@@ precise as the verbal description of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely precise .
because you can &apos;t smell the flowers in the verbal description of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the whis@@ per@@ ing of the wind .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must translate these im@@ precise indic@@ ations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , concrete , non @-@ verbal musical language .
today I &apos;d like to verb@@ ally translate what I usually translate into music , or interpret .
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
that &apos;s why I prefer to do it all in German , because if I &apos;d have to translate it into English , that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation .
the So , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
there are different grades here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passi@@ vely or whether you can also actively speak it , all the way to the musical native speaker .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
once you &apos;ve selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition &apos;s creation .
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expressed by the composer themselves .
you study works that have been composed before or after .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
the reasons for writing it .
how and what did they feel ?
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
all that interests me .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surrounding the composer as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them regularly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the composer .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
as the note is anything but a precise indic@@ ation of the desire of a composer , and is , rather , a framework , I will now u@@ til@@ ise this framework to fill it with sense and meaning .
then I will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
I play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
every note , every phrase is thus given a sense , because I feel it myself , because it comes from what I &apos;ve personally experienced .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise I won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
it always makes for a happy concert when I have the fortune to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though I &apos;ve been working on it for so long in advance .
it &apos;s like experiencing a happy new day af@@ res@@ h , even though you go through the same rituals , getting up , having breakfast , going to work , I experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
I &apos;m a day older , the seasons change , my pulse is slower in the evening than it is in the morning , in a concert hall it takes longer for the rever@@ ber@@ ation to return than it does at home .
I &apos;m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or un@@ consciously .
all this influences me and influences my experience of the composition .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when I &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wavel@@ ength .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul@@ ating conversation .
you introduce a new idea and this is answered in@@ stan@@ taneously with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communic@@ ates in a li@@ vely way .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
I will never again play as I did in this moment .
I won &apos;t be able to play like I do today in twenty years .
I will have more life experience than today and so my musical pal@@ ette will have many more nu@@ ances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
sure , I will have thrown some colors away too , but I will have added new ones to take their place .
I have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher Professor J@@ ür@@ gen U@@ de , a well @-@ known Beethoven specialist , concert pi@@ anist and lon@@ g@@ standing professor at the conserv@@ atory here in Stu@@ tt@@ g@@ art .
I was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already retired before I finally started studying .
but I had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when I was thir@@ teen , and so I always atten@@ ded his courses while I was at school .
I was se@@ vent@@ een when I took part in a course of his and played the last of Chop@@ in &apos;s four ball@@ ads , one of his later works .
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this ball@@ ad was in my opinion .
it &apos;s a sol@@ em@@ n part .
and , being young , I said , expectation .
he sm@@ iled and said , oh ?
that must be our difference in age .
because to me it means memory .
he was over six@@ ty at the time .
well , at se@@ vent@@ een you still have dreams , but no significant memories .
today , I play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because I read something new in it every time .
another example from a very different field . Mon@@ et painted his Wat@@ er@@ li@@ lies an infinite number of times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
he translated the water@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
his personal impres@@ sions of the water@@ li@@ lies .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the ump@@ teen@@ th time is comparable in this way .
now I am also older than Chop@@ in when he wrote the piece at thirty @-@ two .
he only lived until the age of thirty @-@ nine .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if I think I know them by heart .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
like I said , you need about as much time as you do for a spoken language .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
you practically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
beginn@@ ers &apos; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
well , so it says pres@@ to at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
Len@@ to , slow .
the loud and soft symbols , F and B , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
most people here have heard of them .
but even if you implement these indic@@ ations , it still just remains something technical .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
I &apos;m surprised .
I &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very elementary .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance .
which is singing .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ onate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
people who have never sung con@@ sequently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a tone .
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
we use our voc@@ al ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fingers .
the melody is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhythm is created through dance .
the constant floo@@ ding of music today is not very beneficial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bored .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
all one &apos;s own music is destroyed because you &apos;re constantly being bombar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
then I ask you this , can you not sing , A , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or B , Because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscles that att@@ une the voc@@ al ch@@ or@@ ds .
because you can train that .
or C , Because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ itable .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compet@@ ent was this diagnosis ?
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nicely nowadays ?
or D , You simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
which I would very much regret , because music is a lovely , communic@@ ative thing .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , I don &apos;t understand a thing about classical music .
I can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
then my answer is , but I &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
because I don &apos;t think anyone will say , I don &apos;t know whether I like the taste , because I can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ stain from food just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ stain from listening to classical music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
whether the music is too pe@@ p@@ per@@ y or sweet for your taste .
say what you feel .
with time , you will have demands and will want to have more sp@@ ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
why do I demand from my audience that they listen actively ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
a work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it .
so please listen when music is played .
it is not only a nice w@@ all@@ paper made of noise .
when a child grows up in an environment where the adults actively make music or at least actively lis@@ tens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and it will sound completely different from before .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
instruments have developed .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in Bach &apos;s time .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
I think Bach would have been very enthusias@@ tic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pi@@ an@@ os have .
I can make Bach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a b@@ aro@@ que har@@ p@@ sich@@ ord was not able to .
of Beethoven we know that he listened more once he &apos;d already gone deaf .
today a modern orchestra can play anything that was rejected as un@@ play@@ able at the time .
that &apos;s why compos@@ ers depend on us interpre@@ ters to reinvent the pieces again and again .
so that what they had only con@@ jured up in their minds becomes lis@@ ten@@ able .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
or anything that I imagine because they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you ever en@@ vi@@ ous ?
and how did you feel ?
terrible .
I have a friend who drives a Pass@@ er@@ ati .
when I turn up in my little V@@ W cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , I get this feeling .
something shoo@@ ts through my head .
I say , Ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and anyway , you work a lot less than I do .
why do I have to get such a small car ?
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s unfair .
it goes against justice .
and when I say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
our organism has come up with an excellent method to make un@@ pleasant feelings like envy simply disappear .
you can also try it with words like re@@ v@@ enge or acqu@@ isi@@ tiveness and the like .
I would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any intention of building a wall .
and then they start pil@@ ing up stones so your view is blocked .
a lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
and it &apos;s easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind .
he &apos;s only dec@@ ei@@ ving you and not himself .
no , the lie I &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self @-@ deception , upright .
this is harder to check or bring down .
you need time .
an anec@@ dote you might know talks about this time .
the Spanish painter P@@ abl@@ o Picasso once painted a portrait of a woman .
the woman then compla@@ ined that the portrait didn &apos;t look anything like her .
Picasso &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
it will start to look more and more like you .
at this point and if you &apos;re laughing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
because artists have a distor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
then that un@@ pleasant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a grandi@@ ose invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tales , fol@@ k@@ tales , in in mythology , in stories .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at herself in the mirror every day and said , who is the fair@@ est of them all ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you .
over the hills and all that .
and you also know how much hos@@ tility ar@@ ises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political correc@@ tness here .
we need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tales , but also in science .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the B@@ ish@@ op of Wor@@ c@@ ester .
she heard about this book by Charles Darwin , The Ori@@ gin of Spe@@ cies and The Des@@ cent of Man .
that humans are supposed to have descen@@ ded from apes and that , yes , there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what Charles has written is not true .
that the human descen@@ ded from apes and we have a shared ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
to show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grandi@@ ose image of ourselves , I would like to share another story with you .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
my wife told me it .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pup@@ ils .
an autistic pup@@ il .
she likes him a lot , because he has the tendency to be for@@ th@@ right .
and she asked him , so what are your h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es ?
and then he said , well , I &apos;m with the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
and because I &apos;m with the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , I &apos;m interested in p@@ y@@ ro@@ technical things .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
I told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although I &apos;m with the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , I &apos;m interested in p@@ y@@ ro@@ technical things .
you sense that that &quot; s the actual truth behind the sentence .
a young l@@ ad like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fires .
he &apos;s interested in setting fires .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
and moreover , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire fl@@ ares up .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the danger that others create when they set a fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this This hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out loud .
we know that something else is really true .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively distur@@ bed .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
I &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
according to which logic do we disse@@ min@@ ate this deception , this self @-@ deception , this willingness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ?
I would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustrate this .
the first example works with the presum@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
I &apos;m talking about the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something mental , Lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
it does not have a tangible , material nature .
and when this breath of air p@@ ours out onto a human , the human is filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul .
and then it can leave you .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
because now you can implement a rule of three .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way .
this rule of three contains three theor@@ ems .
the first theor@@ em is , Kl@@ aus claims there is no soul .
the second theor@@ em is thus , if Kl@@ aus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now we have the third theor@@ em .
I high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
so you sense it already .
here this logic is expressed in this dec@@ ep@@ tive dis@@ course .
you see it straight away .
the first two theor@@ ems are log@@ ically correct .
I can claim anything .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
I can say , the German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is a man .
and if I &apos;m right , then the Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is a man .
if I &apos;m not right , then the Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is not a man .
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
I can claim anything .
what is dec@@ isi@@ ve , if I &apos;m right , then it &apos;s valid .
so when Kl@@ aus says , there is no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are log@@ ically correct .
and now our dec@@ ep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , I can do something with this .
so it att@@ aches a third theor@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor@@ ems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor@@ em had already been proven and given priority .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theor@@ ems are log@@ ically correct and att@@ aches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can apply these things to other examples .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow @-@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ teen@@ th
century .
there was a schol@@ ar called Jean Bur@@ id@@ an , and Bur@@ id@@ an &apos;s ass was named after him .
Bur@@ id@@ an &apos;s ass is an ass that is made purely of nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you put it exactly between two equally big Ha@@ yst@@ acks , it will star@@ ve .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ yst@@ ack it should go to first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imagined .
two equally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ nat@@ ures will can@@ cel each other out .
nothing will happen .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ yst@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determined by the larger ha@@ yst@@ ack that immediately attrac@@ ts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we &apos;re here in Frank@@ fur@@ t am M@@ ain , I &apos;ll remind you of the Max -@@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a schol@@ ar there , his name is Wol@@ f S@@ inger , and sometimes people say , Wol@@ f S@@ inger claims , there is no free will .
now we can come up with the second theor@@ em and say : if Wol@@ f S@@ inger is right , then he has no free will .
these theor@@ ems are absolutely logical and correct .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theor@@ em .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of uns@@ o@@ und mind .
here you have it again .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
but the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theor@@ em were false from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any proof .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predic@@ tors .
and don &apos;t use the German word for predic@@ tors , which would be proph@@ et .
you must@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little politically in@@ correct .
say , there are no predic@@ tors .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predic@@ tors , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
because while you are busy telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predic@@ tors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved you .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the necess@@ ity to prove that there are predic@@ tors .
so through this mode of passing on the burden of pro@@ ving something you are experiencing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
and if you have another opportunity to en@@ act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don &apos;t remind them of their self @-@ deception .
thank you for your attention .
yes , hello .
I took the liberty I asked L@@ il@@ ly , if it would be okay to mention her .
she &apos;s one of the organiz@@ ers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
I must honestly say , and you witnessed this , I found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
and she said I should perhaps present my island project , which I will try to present to you .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
and then I went to Berlin in the mid @-@ eigh@@ ties because I wanted to study renewable energi@@ es and they didn &apos;t have that in Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
there was the Leop@@ ol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen nuclear research plant .
they were all called K@@ F@@ As at the time , the place in J@@ ü@@ lich was also called a K@@ F@@ A .
today they &apos;re called project execu@@ ting organizations .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ dul@@ um , which has an output of something like one hundred watt per square met@@ re , that was a toy .
and in Berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
I &apos;m grateful to the person behind pre@@ mium Cola that he rehabili@@ tated that word again , because after the Wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left @-@ wing was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the eigh@@ ties .
at that time , there were self @-@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in Kreuz@@ berg in Mehr@@ in@@ gh@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
a terrorist place , but it was was called W@@ usel@@ tron@@ ik and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where I started out in the mid @-@ eigh@@ ties .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which I also was part of .
I worked in the collective for el@@ even years , it was based on a grassroots democracy .
we were a group of twenty people .
he &apos;s wasting his time on nonsense .
I &apos;ve brought along a project I &apos;d like to introduce to you .
the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energi@@ es .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could implement a reser@@ vo@@ ir wis@@ ely today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island Gr@@ aci@@ os@@ a on A@@ z@@ ores .
yes , here is the data .
four and a half thousand people live there .
they have a renewable energy share of fif@@ teen percent at the moment .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because technolog@@ ically it &apos;s just not possible .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
that &apos;s what I always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in Berlin @-@ Ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of .
they then also say , why ?
we have twenty percent in Germany .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in Europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the European one .
if we had twenty percent in Europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
the question is just , calculate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thirty , forty , fifty , maybe even se@@ v@@ enty percent renewable energi@@ es .
and yes , I &apos;ll move on a slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about one hundred gig@@ a@@ watts electrical output on dies@@ el fuel basis is added in the world per year .
that &apos;s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is rel@@ iev@@ ed with dies@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a license for it .
it goes fast .
you put a box like this over there .
and that generally looks like this .
in it , there are always three dies@@ els running , two are always main@@ tained .
yes , that &apos;s what a What you see at the bottom is the load .
we were given very accurate data .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back @-@ up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
the dies@@ el will be the back @-@ up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and if you want to exce@@ ed twenty , thirty percent renewable energi@@ es , you have to switch off dies@@ el .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energi@@ es can take over the entire network .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your s@@ having machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
people always ask me , what are you researching in Ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
that is do@@ able .
but if you want to hook up several of these power in@@ ver@@ ters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydrogen methane , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill electro@@ chemical battery .
how far would you get with that ?
and then we tried out a whole load of simul@@ ations .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay ,
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the dies@@ el system , if the price of dies@@ el rises by five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the Is@@ lan@@ ders .
what needed to be done ?
we negoti@@ ated with investors , I looked for new shar@@ eholders .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation .
and here you have the graphic again .
the brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent dies@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
and the Power U@@ tility , which which the electric utility on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
they said , We want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in Berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
naturally it &apos;s from Asia , in this case from Japan .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the BBC Mann@@ heim , called A@@ B@@ B today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the Japanese .
it is You can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a mega@@ watt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
and then presented .
over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system , the cable &apos;s kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic output of two hundred kil@@ ow@@ att + to the network .
we can see it again here We can see the dies@@ el again here , and all the individual aggre@@ gates here .
and what we did , the hall was completed in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed practically everything that could be developed electron@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
so we &apos;re not battery manufacturers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energi@@ es .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
we can start integr@@ ating electr@@ o @-@ mobility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
that means that if you &apos;re at se@@ v@@ enty percent renewable energi@@ es , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this rotating mass , which causes a certain amount of I@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network .
and our European energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of Europe .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
and in that time you can react differently .
if you don &apos;t have this rotating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electronics and electr@@ o @-@ chemistry .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two m@@ illis@@ econds .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and so the message is this , We have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc .
and then we have to decrease our must @-@ run capac@@ ities in the network .
must @-@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , additional construction of coal @-@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capac@@ ities , the must @-@ run capac@@ ities , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
thank@@ fully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anticipate .
and many discussions I had in the last six years were similar to the discussion I had in the last thirty years reg@@ arding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s nonsense , a play@@ thing for kids , we calculated everything , it will never add up .
we have thirty gig@@ a@@ watt of photo @-@ vol@@ ta@@ ic power in Germany .
that &apos;s ex@@ empl@@ ary .
and I simply assume that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thirty years .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
there will be a whole load of resistance and arguments .
the nice thing is that I &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million funded projects , also to attach a ten @-@ mega@@ watt battery to the German network .
that will take place next April .
so you &apos;re noticing a change is taking place , from a defen@@ sive attitude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renewable energi@@ es is right .
and when you have one hundred percent renewable energi@@ es , then it &apos;s like a self @-@ sufficient system .
up till now the following is always argued in discussions , These Is@@ lan@@ ders are becoming self @-@ sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network .
the The question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are dri@@ lled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and I am grateful to the Cra@@ dle to Cra@@ dle institute that they said , U@@ se solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming together , also if you look at the presentation by pre@@ mium Cola , that it &apos;s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
and yes , well , I &apos;d just like to motivate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty firm while doing so , but I think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
thank you .
