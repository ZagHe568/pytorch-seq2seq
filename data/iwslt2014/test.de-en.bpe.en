one day , Los Angeles Times colum@@ n@@ ist Steve L@@ op@@ ez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an African @-@ American man , charming , ru@@ gged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r. acting as Steve L@@ op@@ ez , and Jamie Fo@@ x@@ x as Nathaniel Anthony A@@ yers , the Ju@@ illi@@ ard @-@ trained double bass@@ ist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic aff@@ lic@@ tion with paran@@ oid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel dropped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Sk@@ id R@@ ow in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
I met Mr. A@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at W@@ alt Disney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall .
he had just heard a performance of Beethoven &apos;s First and F@@ our@@ th sym@@ phon@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Yo @-@ Yo M@@ a and Hillary Clinton and how the Dod@@ gers were never going to make the World S@@ eries , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th Sym@@ phony .
and we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , I should mention that Nathaniel ref@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thor@@ azine and hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Sk@@ id R@@ ow , exposed to its hor@@ rors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind unle@@ ashed upon him .
and Nathaniel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at W@@ alt Disney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smoke , and how someone was pois@@ oning him in his sleep .
and I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ru@@ in his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ actic violin pe@@ d@@ ag@@ og@@ y .
so , I just started playing .
and I played the first movement of the Beethoven Vi@@ ol@@ in Con@@ cer@@ to .
and as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cataly@@ st .
and Nathaniel &apos;s man@@ ic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain sni@@ pp@@ ets of violin concer@@ tos which he then asked me to complete -- M@@ end@@ els@@ so@@ hn , T@@ cha@@ ik@@ ov@@ sky , Si@@ beli@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Bra@@ h@@ ms , Bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from Bar@@ t@@ รณ@@ k , all the way up to Es@@ a @-@ P@@ ek@@ ka Sal@@ onen .
and I understood that he not only had an en@@ cyclopedi@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paran@@ oid , distur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , brilliant , Ju@@ illi@@ ard @-@ trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for Nathaniel , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ usions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tor@@ mented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspir@@ es and un@@ ites us .
and for Nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at W@@ alt Disney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall or on Sk@@ id R@@ ow , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something that I sham@@ elessly st@@ ole from cell@@ ists .
so , please forgive me .
so , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a bes@@ ts@@ eller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm @-@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; I said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this un@@ imaginable problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear @-@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms poll@@ ute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tuna , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif@@ teen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
the day before the event , I called the head of P@@ .@@ R. for the company .
let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t poll@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed con@@ version ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; I said . got off the phone .
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pel@@ lets .
I said , &quot; Chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone meal , scr@@ aps , dri@@ ed and processed into feed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
I fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m some self @-@ righ@@ te@@ ous , go@@ o@@ dy @-@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
I actually am .
no , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swe@@ ar to God , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost sh@@ immer@@ ing , white color .
the chef had over@@ cooked it .
like twice over .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ cooked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him Mig@@ uel -- actually his name is Mig@@ uel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at V@@ et@@ a La Pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the South@@ western corner of Spain .
it &apos;s at the tip of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argent@@ in@@ ians .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wet@@ lands .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
they built this intricate series of can@@ als , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and ec@@ ologically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purch@@ ased the land .
what did they do ?
they re@@ vers@@ ed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
they floo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7,000 @-@ acre fish farm -- b@@ ass , mul@@ let , shrimp , e@@ el -- and in the process , Mig@@ uel and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ecological destruction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are floo@@ ded can@@ als and this thick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with Mig@@ uel .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Cro@@ codi@@ le Dun@@ dee .
okay ? there we are s@@ logging through the wet@@ lands , and I &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mud up to my knees , and Mig@@ uel &apos;s cal@@ mly conducting a biology lecture .
here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black @-@ shoul@@ dered K@@ ite .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tioning the min@@ eral needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kton .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that reminds him of the Tanz@@ an@@ ian gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out , Mig@@ uel spent the better part of his career in the Mik@@ um@@ i National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aquatic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ plug@@ ged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but I was in love .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ cooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
so I interrupted him . I said , &quot; Mig@@ uel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the algae .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the algae , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ratio ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ kton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self @-@ rene@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , I was driving around this property with Mig@@ uel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , pink .
they &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
Fe@@ ast@@ ing ? I was totally confused .
I said , &quot; Mig@@ uel , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 60@@ 0,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ ctu@@ aries in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Mig@@ uel , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sh@@ ook his head , no .
he said , &quot; We farm exten@@ sively , not intensi@@ vely .
this is an ecological network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ kton .
so the pin@@ ker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ ctu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building n@@ ests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway A@@ 92 .
no kidding .
I was imagining a &quot; March of the Pen@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I looked at Mig@@ uel .
I said , &quot; Mig@@ uel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like I had just quo@@ ted a Whit@@ ney Hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it sear@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it cris@@ py .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , tar @-@ like flavor .
I almost never cook with it .
yet , when I ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to Mig@@ uel , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
he said , &quot; The skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
OK . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no imp@@ ur@@ ities , &quot; he made a big under@@ statement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r River .
it &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contamin@@ ants , pestici@@ de run@@ off .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
the system is so healthy , it pur@@ i@@ fies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pur@@ i@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it dump@@ s out into the Atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instruc@@ tive .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or beef cattle .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not realis@@ ts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross in@@ equ@@ alities in distribution , not ton@@ n@@ age .
now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pestici@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the jus@@ tification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bread@@ basket is threatened today , not because of dimin@@ ishing supply , but because of dimin@@ ishing resources .
not by the latest combine and trac@@ tor invention , but by fer@@ tile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
that &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on @-@ the @-@ job experience .
look to Mig@@ uel , farmers like Mig@@ uel .
farms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; farms that restore instead of deple@@ te ; farms that farm exten@@ sively instead of just intensi@@ vely ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
and if I &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than I &apos;ll ever be .
you know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ v@@ ot , and with pi@@ v@@ ot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents .
and , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
this is because , in the mid @-@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organize the data by cause of death , seeing that circul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual suspe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information inf@@ o @-@ graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single Spor@@ ts Illu@@ strated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ v@@ ot , you can drill into a decade .
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Armstrong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which L@@ ance Armstrong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
so I can step back , and expand on that .
and I see Greg Le@@ Mond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , broader , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so I want to extr@@ apol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
so the summary consists of just a little syn@@ op@@ sis and an icon to indicate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summar@@ ies , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my boss -- and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ gating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page @-@ to @-@ page , but at a higher level of abstr@@ action .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
I &apos;m just showing the New York Times website here .
so pi@@ v@@ ot , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
so I can drill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
and I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
and , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ tistic searching , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Live Lab@@ s pi@@ v@@ ot .
and from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about drow@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navi@@ gating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
in high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curiosity that I had .
and you know , that curiosity also manifes@@ ted itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , I was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mir@@ ror@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
so , that seemed to res@@ onate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
and I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this satur@@ ation of C@@ G movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ lessly getting bu@@ sted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ eship someday -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n unlikely .
but that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
so , I decided I was going to become a sc@@ uba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
but I didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
I p@@ ester@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ uba class in Buff@@ alo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I actually got certified in a pool at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the dead of winter in Buff@@ alo , New York .
and I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submer@@ si@@ bles .
and I &apos;ve learned that that deep @-@ ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when I chose a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconci@@ le this urge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; Ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s . &quot;
and with &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film@@ making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passions .
something interesting came out of &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embrac@@ ed computer generated animation , C@@ G .
and this resul@@ ted in the first soft @-@ surface character , C@@ G animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- barely broke even , I should say -- I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this apparent magic .
you know , it &apos;s Arthur Clar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suffici@@ ently advanced technology is in@@ distingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
they were seeing something magical .
and so that got me very excited .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embrac@@ ed into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther .
working with I@@ L@@ M , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital Dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ frog past the analog processes of optical pr@@ inters and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves lag@@ ging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
so , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of C@@ G effects , beyond , with realistic human emo@@ tive characters generated in C@@ G , and the main characters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
and the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , I shel@@ ved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , I went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Rom@@ e@@ o and Juli@@ et &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this ep@@ ic romance , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why I made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . &quot;
and I talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port .
not a movie , not HD -- for real .
now , that blew my mind .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and I thought like , &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep @-@ ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it -- it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ sequent expedi@@ tions , I was seeing creatures at hydro@@ thermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
so , I was completely s@@ mitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full @-@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these And we wound up going to the Bis@@ mark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the Titanic wreck .
we took little bo@@ ts that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fiber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
and I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ dor of the ship .
when I say , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physically present inside the shi@@ p@@ wreck of Titanic .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact replic@@ a on the blue@@ prints of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tel@@ ep@@ res@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is inje@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ borg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post @-@ human fu@@ tures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth .
they live in an environment of chem@@ osyn@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t survive on sunlight @-@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500 @-@ degree @-@ C@@ enti@@ grade You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advis@@ ory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre @-@ cos@@ mon@@ aut biomedi@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ biologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . but I also learned a lot Now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expedi@@ tions .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
people sort of think I went away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avat@@ ar &quot; and was buff@@ ing my n@@ ails some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly kn@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ uation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human @-@ performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Avat@@ ar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here I was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted territory , doing &quot; Avat@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four @-@ and @-@ half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , people have com@@ mented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ ora . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthes@@ ize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , I think number one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rels in the world .
I have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; Give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
and I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full @-@ time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ eled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 190@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refriger@@ ators , air @-@ conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constra@@ int , and that constra@@ int has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
if you sum up the CO2 that gets emit@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive fe@@ ed@@ backs are , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve @-@ foot @-@ high truck trying to get under a ten @-@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multip@@ lication : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ gebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6.@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ comp@@ asses everything : the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street l@@ amps .
now , efficiency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring S@@ ome individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fertilizer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
and so , overall here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mir@@ acles .
now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ processor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the Internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have particip@@ ated in the creation of many mir@@ acles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight tim@@ eline .
now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that releasing fire@@ flies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of g@@ imm@@ ick@@ y solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I &apos;ve left out tide , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fuels .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ unting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ sur@@ ize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agre@@ eing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the tough@@ est one here is this long @-@ term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ advantages .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and , finally , this storage problem .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flash@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a Manhattan Project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
Bill Gr@@ oss has several companies , including one called e@@ Solar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ hos@@ la &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : mod@@ ular , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ anium -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 38 . &quot;
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the adv@@ ent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it breath@@ es this ur@@ anium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
you can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called deple@@ ted ur@@ anium .
that would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ tering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ mediate .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up fores@@ try , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
so , the other grade is : are we deplo@@ ying this zero @-@ emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reduc@@ tions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the Al Gore book , &quot; Our Cho@@ ice &quot; and the David Mc@@ Kay book , &quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able En@@ ergy Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot Air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed bro@@ adly , because we need broad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the CO2 .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
we do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understand@@ able dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Power , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
B@@ il Gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ anium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
B@@ G : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always refu@@ eling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complex@@ ities .
and it just sits there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dispos@@ al solution .
B@@ G : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry cas@@ king by reactors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clos@@ ure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ tary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
so I &apos;m optimistic . you know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G : well , we need -- for one of these high @-@ scale , electr@@ o @-@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
that &apos;s sort of the dead@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , Ter@@ ra@@ Power , if things go well -- which is wis@@ hing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
in terms of big @-@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
B@@ G : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental constra@@ int , but the environmental constra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid @-@ type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ anium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
B@@ G : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over @-@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
climate skep@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
B@@ G : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the I@@ PC@@ C report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at I@@ PC@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the B@@ j@@ orn L@@ om@@ borg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that &apos;s non @-@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the trade @-@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even L@@ om@@ borg has changed .
his sh@@ tick now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &amp; amp ; D getting more discussed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lonely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the R &amp; amp ; D point .
and so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
the R &amp; amp ; D piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
B@@ G : thank you .
several years ago here at TED , Peter Sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ shmallow challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tall@@ est free @-@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a mar@@ shmallow .
the mar@@ shmallow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design work@@ shops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the C@@ T@@ Os of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ckey for power .
then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sticks into ever @-@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ shmallow , and then they ging@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta @-@ da ! -- they admire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh @-@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ shmallow causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
they lie , they cheat , they get distrac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tall@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of spaghetti , In@@ c . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they exec@@ ute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ shmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ shmallow , and they build prototypes , suc@@ c@@ essive prototypes , always keeping the mar@@ shmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iter@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thank@@ fully .
thirty @-@ nine inches is the tall@@ est structure I &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self @-@ rein@@ forcing geomet@@ rical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so CEOs , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an executive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ foreh@@ and . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of facili@@ tation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who man@@ ages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
specialized skills and facili@@ tation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
so I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high st@@ akes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tall@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ shmallow challenge ?
and the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ shmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own mar@@ shmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ shm@@ all@@ ow@@ Ch@@ allen@@ ge@@ .com.
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ shm@@ allows .
there &apos;s step @-@ by @-@ step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ weak and adjust the system .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , TED @-@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go backwards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or &quot; American I@@ dol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostal@@ gia , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
and I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that crowd , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m advent@@ ur@@ ous .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great @-@ grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it res@@ h@@ aped the dem@@ ography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , rub@@ ella , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accompl@@ ish@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our accompl@@ ish@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
that number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thor@@ ough@@ ly trash this globe .
po@@ table water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the En@@ ligh@@ tenment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progress , when we fought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s en@@ titled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even en@@ titled to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not en@@ titled to ?
you &apos;re not en@@ titled to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . a little story .
and I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
and soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Fran@@ ken@@ foods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a h@@ ap@@ haz@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ passing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ thered me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just distur@@ bed me so much .
but then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quo@@ tes around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
Cher@@ nobyl , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ allen@@ ger , Vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , hanging ch@@ ads .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the meas@@ les , m@@ umps and rub@@ ella vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anec@@ do@@ tes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been dis@@ astr@@ ous .
dis@@ astr@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like J@@ enny Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and illiter@@ acy from platforms like &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link caus@@ ation and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , Jonas Sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is Paul Off@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 50@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , Paul &apos;s a terrorist .
when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t tes@@ ti@@ fy without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because Paul made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vacc@@ inate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over Ohio .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous TED d@@ inners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
Ech@@ in@@ ace@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
I &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , I think I understand , we hate Big ph@@ ar@@ ma .
we hate Big Govern@@ ment . we don &apos;t trust the Man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely aston@@ ish@@ ingly cold and soul @-@ bending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of Big Pl@@ ac@@ ebo .
that &apos;s fantastic . I love Big Pl@@ ac@@ ebo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , frau@@ d ; ech@@ in@@ ace@@ a , frau@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s frau@@ d .
and you know what ? when I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ tary of H@@ HS who &apos;s saying , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mamm@@ ograms , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in T@@ hab@@ o M@@ be@@ ki South Africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people by ins@@ isting that beet@@ root , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the antiretro@@ viral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less deaths in a country that has been pl@@ agu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mind@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
it &apos;s an idi@@ otic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sp@@ rig of par@@ s@@ ley , every Br@@ us@@ sels spr@@ out has been modified by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of Eden .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t Christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things I constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pestici@@ des , hormones , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ dening , and it &apos;s preventing millions of people from prosper@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful . Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for instance .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be Che@@ z Pan@@ isse , but it would be nice .
and all I can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our ins@@ istence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
this isn &apos;t about R@@ ice Kris@@ p@@ ies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re guilty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of : high @-@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Som@@ e@@ thing fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ mentary , very simple magic trick .
and I &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s .
I learned it myself from Cu@@ b Sc@@ out Mag@@ ic in the 1970s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
and then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my f@@ ist like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve I &apos;m just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I &apos;m squee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magne@@ tism will hold the knife .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no trick@@ ery . and you can examine everything .
ta @-@ da !
so , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick method@@ ologically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
the reason I &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as I move around my finger shifts .
and we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then I open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tism , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery , my index finger being there .
and then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . you give the knife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
if you have cap@@ s@@ ules , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
a colored cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
dos@@ age has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don &apos;t remember the statistic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these dos@@ ages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle .
right ? a sy@@ ringe with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ S of some in@@ ert something , and you inject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the needle .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
this is a seven @-@ inch hat@@ pin . it &apos;s very , very sharp , and I &apos;m going to just steri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my flesh . this is not Dam@@ ian &apos;s special @-@ grown flesh .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a Hollywood special effect .
I &apos;m going to p@@ ier@@ ce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , I suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little p@@ ier@@ ce .
I &apos;m sorry , man . am I fre@@ aking you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , I know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a Hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my flesh , and I can twist that around .
I &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , I would take the needle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
but I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tr@@ aps .
this applies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well @-@ being is .
the second trap is a conf@@ usion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both l@@ ump@@ ed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affects well @-@ being without distor@@ ting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question @-@ and @-@ answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dread@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re @-@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; D@@ oes it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your trip to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a painful procedure .
I won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings .
and you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , Patient B suffered more -- his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than Patient B.
the stories of the colon@@ os@@ copies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colon@@ os@@ copy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have end@@ owed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
what defines a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 60@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two @-@ week vacation is twice as good as the one @-@ week vacation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
for the remembering self , a two @-@ week vacation is barely better than the one @-@ week vacation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distingu@@ ishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ os@@ copies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ oses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticip@@ ated memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of drag@@ ging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
and this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
that is one of the explanations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remembering self .
and when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vac@@ ations .
and I probably have consumed my memories of that three @-@ week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if I had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy .
now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so I want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well @-@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
the Gall@@ up Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice vers@@ a .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you have that much uncertainty .
if I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitu@@ te for well @-@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well @-@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gall@@ up survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
Daniel K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man : sure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gall@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 60@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample -- below an income of 60@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
60,000 .
D@@ K : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progres@@ sively un@@ happier the poorer they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
D@@ K : you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life eval@@ uation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
this is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
in the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you , Danny K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man .
I &apos;m Jane Mc@@ Gon@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , I have a plan for this , and it ent@@ ails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at The Institute For The Fu@@ ture , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
in fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
I &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to asp@@ ire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . I &apos;m serious . I am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Tol@@ e@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tac@@ kling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyeb@@ rows up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the verge of something called an ep@@ ic win .
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . OK , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an ep@@ ic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an ep@@ ic win .
this is a gam@@ er on the verge of an ep@@ ic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem @-@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an ep@@ ic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
this is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gra@@ ffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters , inspired to collaborate and to cooperate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed , we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cyn@@ ical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real @-@ world work ?
so , I looked at games like World of War@@ craft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem @-@ solving environment .
and I started to notice a few things that make ep@@ ic wins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of War@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world @-@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in World of War@@ craft .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your ep@@ ic mission .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ tips are tons of collaborators .
and also there is this ep@@ ic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of le@@ veling up and plus @-@ one strength , and plus @-@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when I get off this stage I &apos;m not going to have plus @-@ one speaking , and plus @-@ one crazy idea , plus @-@ 20 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of War@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an ep@@ ic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , collectively all the World of War@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5.@@ 93 million years solving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ oth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5.@@ 93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first upright primate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hear@@ ty species .
this is true . I believe this .
so , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the United States 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read Malcolm Glad@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ liers . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effor@@ tful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ os@@ os at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broad@@ band Internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gam@@ ers .
so , I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ os@@ os at .
here are the four things I came up with . the first is urgent optimism .
OK , think of this as extreme self @-@ motivation .
urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ os@@ os at wea@@ ving a tight social fabric .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
bl@@ iss@@ ful productivity . I love it .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average World of War@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a half @-@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relax@@ ing , or hanging out .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : ep@@ ic meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be attached to awe @-@ inspiring missions to human planetary @-@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of War@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ iled more information about World of War@@ craft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they are building an ep@@ ic story .
they are building an ep@@ ic knowledge resource about the World of War@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super @-@ empowered , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named Edward Ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witn@@ essing what amounts to no less than a mass exo@@ dus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exu@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewar@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
before we had awesome game controll@@ ers , we had sheep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus says that games , particularly dice games , were invented in the kingdom of Ly@@ dia during a time of famine .
apparently , there was such a severe famine that the king of Ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus , they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom @-@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging , and immer@@ se us in such satisfying bl@@ iss@@ ful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus , they passed 18 years this way , surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to escape real @-@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic adventure .
they would leave Ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , DNA evidence has shown that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that Her@@ o@@ do@@ tus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing War@@ craft since 1994 .
that was the first real @-@ time strategy game from the World of War@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing War@@ craft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game @-@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real @-@ world problems .
now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what I have devoted my work to over the past few years , at The Institute For The Fu@@ ture .
we have this ban@@ ner in our offices in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best @-@ case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine ep@@ ic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the ep@@ ic win .
I &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create ep@@ ic wins in their own fu@@ tures .
so , this is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real @-@ time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is ri@@ o@@ ting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pil@@ o@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
and I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic adventure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
so , for the next world @-@ saving game , we decided to aim higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called Super@@ stru@@ ct at The Institute For The Fu@@ ture .
and the premise was a super@@ computer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the Global Ex@@ tin@@ ction A@@ war@@ eness System , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a Jerry Bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
you know Jerry Bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astron@@ aut , the scientist , the ex @-@ convi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Every@@ body &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you Google &quot; Super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it March 3@@ r@@ d . this is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
if you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank Institute , as a Social innov@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with universities all over sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ veling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and res@@ our@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
so , I &apos;m going to wrap up now .
I want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well I hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do real @-@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ powers : bl@@ iss@@ ful productivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for ep@@ ic meaning .
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , I say : let the world @-@ changing games begin .
thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired .
I always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
let me read you the entry .
&quot; disabled , ad@@ je@@ ctive : crip@@ pled , helpless , useless , w@@ reck@@ ed , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ unded , man@@ gled , l@@ ame , mutil@@ ated , run @-@ down , wor@@ n @-@ out , weak@@ ened , im@@ potent , ca@@ strated , paralyzed , han@@ dic@@ apped , sen@@ ile , decre@@ pit , laid @-@ up , done @-@ up , done @-@ for , done @-@ in cracked @-@ up , counted @-@ out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
Anton@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the ass@@ ault from these words unle@@ ashed .
you know , of course , this is my rag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so I &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , need@@ less to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ au@@ rus back then .
I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and advent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cured .
so , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion , expecting to find a re@@ vision worth no@@ ting .
here &apos;s the up@@ dated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; Ne@@ ar Anton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly uns@@ ett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ oles@@ ome . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Rom@@ ans , believed that to utter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ?
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and casting shadows on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A@@ .@@ I. Du@@ pon@@ t Institute in Wil@@ m@@ ington , Del@@ aware .
his name was Dr. P@@ iz@@ zu@@ till@@ o , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pron@@ ounce , so he went by Dr. P.
and Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
I had to do what seemed like in@@ numer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exerc@@ ises with these thick , elas@@ tic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
and , you know , I was already bar@@ gaining , as a five year @-@ old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exerc@@ ises , un@@ successfully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- ex@@ haus@@ tive and un@@ for@@ giving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
when you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exerc@@ ises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospe@@ ct of being the richest five @-@ year @-@ old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ h@@ ape an awful daily occurr@@ ence into a new and promising experience for me .
and I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his decl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athle@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
but , in the previous instances of those thes@@ au@@ rus ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ anium knees and hip replac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self @-@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ ptions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ign with global groups of their own choosing .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
the human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
implic@@ it in this phrase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ marked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or circum@@ navigate the presum@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
and I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ad@@ vers@@ ity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to res@@ ume living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and I tend to think of it like my shadow .
sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to dimin@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there is ad@@ vers@@ ity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but preparing them to meet it well .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
there &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an ampu@@ tee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I &apos;m disabled .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consistent disability I &apos;ve had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical progn@@ osis , or , indeed , a progn@@ osis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not acknowle@@ dging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human capability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived def@@ ici@@ encies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
so maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grap@@ pling with it , to use a wres@@ tling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate the 200@@ th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illu@@ strated , I think , a truth about the human character .
to parap@@ hrase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
conflict is the gen@@ esis of creation .
from Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re @-@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
ad@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we haven &apos;t adapted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they existed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthrop@@ ologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ at@@ oes .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : I had shor@@ ts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t Aimee Mull@@ ins . &quot;
and I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was Dr. Ke@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s pren@@ at@@ al physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
and , because I was born without the fi@@ bul@@ a bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the be@@ arer -- this stranger had to be the be@@ arer of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; I had to give this progn@@ osis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade sp@@ elling bee , mar@@ ching with the Gir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the Hall@@ ow@@ een par@@ ade , winning my college scholar@@ ship , or any of my sports vic@@ tories , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching res@@ ident students , med students from H@@ ah@@ ne@@ mann Medical School and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medical School .
and he called this part of the course the X Fac@@ tor , the potential of the human will .
no progn@@ osis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and Dr. Ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , Dr. Ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded prosthetics for flesh @-@ and @-@ bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hes@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I aspi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
but if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so recep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; e@@ duce . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from gram@@ mar schools to comprehensive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the States .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
and the &quot; A students &quot; get the tough@@ er curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three @-@ month period , D @-@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three @-@ month period , they were performing at A @-@ level .
and , of course , the heart@@ breaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A @-@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D @-@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curiosity and our inn@@ ate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can Bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ teen@@ th @-@ century Persi@@ an poet named Haf@@ iz that my friend , Jacques Dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who On@@ ly knows Four Wor@@ ds &quot; : &quot; every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose I said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more precise , more accurate and qu@@ icker .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stam@@ ina .
would you like to be more attractive and self @-@ confident ?
how about living longer with good health ?
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always y@@ earned for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about fit@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imagin@@ ary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al topic here at the TED Conference , but I want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
the great 20th @-@ century genetic@@ ist , T@@ .@@ G@@ . D@@ ob@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the Russian Or@@ tho@@ dox Church , once wrote an ess@@ ay that he titled &quot; No@@ thing in Bi@@ ology M@@ akes Sense except in the L@@ ight of evolution . &quot;
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Ka@@ thr@@ yn Schul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , I &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
the human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of homin@@ ids .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can take advantage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat di@@ abe@@ tics ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chem@@ ically in@@ distingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pancre@@ as .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times more .
I mean think of it , when Anton@@ io Dam@@ asi@@ o asks about your self @-@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hosp@@ itable environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
it &apos;s really like an E@@ as@@ y Street for bacteria , with the occasion@@ al inter@@ ruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the di@@ gestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
or , are we destin@@ ed to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of pro@@ to @-@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi @-@ cell@@ ed organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this vast un@@ finished symphony of the universe , life on Earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note .
that was us .
that also constitu@@ tes the entertainment portion of this talk , so I hope you enjoyed it .
now when I was a fresh@@ man in college , I took my first biology class .
I was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
I became en@@ am@@ ored of the power of evolution , and I realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single @-@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time multi @-@ cell@@ ed organisms come online , things start to change .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
and very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
in fact , you could say that the inevit@@ ability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now I have to conf@@ ess , when I was a college undergraduate , I thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , I &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
I &apos;ve come to understand the sentim@@ ents of George Bur@@ ns , who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
he answers the door .
standing before him is a gorgeous , scan@@ ti@@ ly cl@@ ad show@@ girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
I came to realize , as a physician , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradi@@ c@@ tory , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and surviving through generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter rockets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
I think we would all understand the sentim@@ ent that W@@ oo@@ dy Allen expressed when he said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily favor the longest @-@ lived .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fastest , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adapted to their environment .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lic and can survive at the steam v@@ ent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous @-@ vi@@ de cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hosp@@ itable environment for them .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we will not evolve .
we have reached a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
and the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it .
and by the way , we immig@@ rate and circul@@ ate and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ orable .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colon@@ ize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , intriguing and frightening possibility .
I call it neo @-@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the Human Genome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000 @-@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awar@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er Prize to Francis Ar@@ n@@ old and Wil@@ lem S@@ tem@@ mer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what Fran@@ ces Ar@@ n@@ old calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the Las@@ ker Prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist S@@ hin@@ ya Y@@ am@@ an@@ aka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ blast , and by manipul@@ ating just four genes , he induc@@ ed that cell to rever@@ t to a pluri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce immun@@ ity against other viruses .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influ@@ enza that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ b@@ acc@@ o plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ b@@ acc@@ o ?
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
what if you could change the sperm and the o@@ va , or change the newly fertiliz@@ ed egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super @-@ attributes , hyper @-@ capac@@ ities -- that better memory .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a Ken J@@ enn@@ ings , especially if you can au@@ gment it with the next generation of the Watson machine ?
why not have the quick twi@@ t@@ ch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these will be ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old @-@ style evolution into neo @-@ evolution .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can comp@@ ress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
or , will we selec@@ tively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform , or more robust and more ver@@ sa@@ tile ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wis@@ ely ?
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
I want you now to imagine a we@@ arable robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
we at Berkeley Bion@@ ics call these robots ex@@ os@@ kel@@ et@@ ons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ bs@@ . on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major complic@@ ations -- back injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ os@@ kel@@ eton that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introduce to you H@@ U@@ L@@ C -- or the Human Univers@@ al load Car@@ rier .
with the H@@ U@@ L@@ C ex@@ os@@ kel@@ eton , I can carry 200 l@@ bs@@ . over vari@@ ed terrain for many hours .
its flexible design allows for deep squ@@ ats , craw@@ ls and high @-@ ag@@ ility movements .
it senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then aug@@ ments my strength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex@@ os@@ kel@@ eton this year .
so this is for real .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheel@@ chairs worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we are talking here about , of@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ plying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stroke or other complic@@ ations -- is the wheelchair .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
let me now introduce you to e@@ LE@@ G@@ S that is wor@@ n by Amanda Box@@ tel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
thank you .
Amanda is wearing our e@@ LE@@ G@@ S set .
it has sensors .
it &apos;s completely non @-@ invasive , sensors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her knee jo@@ ints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural ga@@ it .
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ hill ski@@ ing paralyzed me .
in a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pel@@ vis .
not long afterwards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
he rob@@ bed every ounce of hope from my being .
adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to down@@ hill ski again , to rock climb and even hand@@ cycle .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in New York , I am the head of development for a non @-@ profit called Robin Ho@@ od .
when I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
now in our town , where the volunteers supp@@ lement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
but still it was a real fo@@ o@@ trace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assign@@ ments would be .
when I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the home@@ owner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an um@@ br@@ ella , in her pa@@ j@@ amas , bar@@ e@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him L@@ ex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ owner &apos;s dog .
the dog ! I was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ousy .
here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
well , I was next .
the captain wa@@ ved me over .
he said , &quot; Be@@ z@@ os , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go up@@ stairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I swe@@ ar .
so , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ fighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .
I carried my pay@@ load back down@@ stairs where I met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the precious dog by the front door .
we took our treas@@ ures outside to the home@@ owner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ owner than@@ king us for the vali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
the act of kindness she no@@ ted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
in both my voc@@ ation at Robin Ho@@ od and my av@@ ocation as a volunteer fire@@ figh@@ ter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monum@@ ental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
and you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a soup kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a mentor .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , Mark , come back .
thank you .
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning Man or San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of wild bon@@ obos in the jun@@ gles of Congo .
Bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are well @-@ known for their aggres@@ sion .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphas@@ is of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution .
but bon@@ obos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by big , scary guys , bon@@ obo society is run by empowered females .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet .
but unfortunately , bon@@ obos are the least understood of the great apes .
they live in the depths of the Con@@ gol@@ ese jungle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has r@@ aged for decades and claim@@ ed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
not surprisingly , this destruction also en@@ dan@@ gers bon@@ obo survival .
B@@ ush@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bon@@ obos that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter s@@ wa@@ ying the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; apes since they have frequent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ exual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
now , I &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ obo life than the K@@ ama Su@@ tra .
Bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fos@@ tering tolerance .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bon@@ obo play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .
play is the glue that bin@@ ds us together .
now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ obo @-@ style -- and I do not mean football .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
only I think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ obos and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ veness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as tes@@ tic@@ les -- and also how play both requires trust and fos@@ ters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ fter .
play &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ fter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imagin@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
and I want you to see , this is Fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insights that bon@@ obo give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ ities .
in other words , play is our adaptive wild@@ card .
in order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our play@@ fulness ?
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
play &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ obos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and c@@ law .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
and so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , f@@ ellow@@ ship and wonder .
thank you .
I want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each concei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
so two cou@@ ples each concei@@ ving one baby .
now I don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome , meeting that X chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying an X chromosome , meeting the X chromosome of the egg .
both are viable ; both take off .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so I wear two hat@@ s in most of what I do .
as the one hat , I do history of anatomy .
I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other hat that I &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activist , as a patient advocate -- or , as I sometimes say , as an imp@@ ati@@ ent advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what I &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
so some of what I &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ joined twins -- two people within one body .
some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ f@@ ism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
and a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pic@@ al sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
Inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
I &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an X@@ Y chromos@@ om@@ al basis , and that S@@ R@@ Y gene on the Y chromosome tells the pro@@ to @-@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fet@@ al life , to become tes@@ tes .
and so in the fet@@ al life the tes@@ tes are pump@@ ing out testosterone .
but because this individual l@@ acks recep@@ tors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
and this is a syndrome called and@@ rogen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing bre@@ asts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ov@@ aries inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has tes@@ tes inside , and she has a Y chromosome .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
females , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a mas@@ cul@@ in@@ izing hormone .
most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don &apos;t actually know my chromos@@ om@@ al make @-@ up but I think I &apos;m probably typical -- most females like me are actually and@@ rogen @-@ sensitive .
we &apos;re making and@@ rogen , and we &apos;re responding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with tes@@ tes who has and@@ rogen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ov@@ aries and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ plas@@ ia .
he had X@@ X chromosomes , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a mas@@ cul@@ ine hormon@@ al environment .
and as a consequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were mas@@ cul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas@@ cul@@ ine component of hormones .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspe@@ cted anything .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
some people who have X@@ X chromosomes develop what are called ov@@ ot@@ es@@ tis , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with tes@@ tic@@ ular tissue wrapped around it .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , or it &apos;s con@@ joined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they thre@@ aten our social categories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history .
and so we have this terribly simpl@@ istic idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ or@@ iz@@ ations .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
well you can imagine how star@@ tling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African run@@ ner , C@@ aster S@@ emen@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the International G@@ ames in Berlin .
I had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; Wh@@ ich is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not C@@ aster S@@ emen@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
and I had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatom@@ ical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be vast@@ ly more complicated than our termin@@ ology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and as we get farther and farther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simpl@@ istic categories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpl@@ istic .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is batt@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fet@@ al life .
we have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ ather on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
if it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you bury them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .
now you might think that all this breaking @-@ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
I &apos;m a political progressive , I defend people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers .
I know they were rac@@ ists , I know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
I mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 76 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 76 with the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers .
the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original anatom@@ ical activists , and this is why .
what they rejected was an anatom@@ ical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all recall , what our Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers were reje@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ archy , and the mon@@ archy was basically based on a very simpl@@ istic concept of anatomy .
the mon@@ ar@@ chs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the anatomy that mat@@ tered was the common@@ ality of anatomy , not the difference in anatomy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an En@@ ligh@@ tenment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alistic world .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explanations , and they were reje@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it transmitted because of a very v@@ ague concept of birth@@ right .
they were moving towards a natur@@ alistic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dependence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s God .
they don &apos;t talk about God and God &apos;s nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatom@@ ical common@@ ality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years afterward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Found@@ ing Fa@@ thers &apos; concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than anatom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and ov@@ aries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women successfully argued that .
next came the successful Civil Rights movement , where we found people like So@@ jour@@ ner Tru@@ th talking about , &quot; A@@ in &apos;t I a woman ? &quot;
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying , &quot; I am a man . &quot;
again , people of color appealing to a common@@ ality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy , again , successfully .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain di@@ visions .
now mind you , I want to maintain some di@@ visions , anatom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
I don &apos;t want to say five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
so there are some anatom@@ ical di@@ visions that make sense to me and that I think we should re@@ tain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings concei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both concei@@ ved in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , Mary , is born three months pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 .
simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
Henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biologically , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of weir@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
Henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the X@@ Y one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which Mary does not need to worry about .
Mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .
Henry can marry in every state a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these anatom@@ ical categories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways problematic and question@@ able .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of prag@@ matic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
but this is also very bizarre , because of the story I told you at the beginning about and@@ rogen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech .
he says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anatomy .
and I want to say , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , I have to admit , that there are some golden Ret@@ ri@@ ever@@ s I know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans I know .
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Lab@@ rad@@ ors that I know that are more capable of informed , intelligent , mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40 @-@ year @-@ olds that I know .
so how do we oper@@ ation@@ alize the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also wonders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an fMRI ?
do we really want to go there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we go .
what I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ dered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
I &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ joined twins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
but when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high @-@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , &quot; Well , have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separation surgery ? &quot;
the United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state .
so I think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , I want to suggest to you that I &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers .
and I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because I &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , I &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from cross @-@ cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more incl@@ ined to be very atten@@ tive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my graduate advis@@ ers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist , as I still do -- asked a really strange question .
he said , &quot; T@@ ell me what &apos;s femin@@ ine about feminism . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well that &apos;s the dum@@ best question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is all about un@@ doing stereotyp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing femin@@ ine about feminism . &quot;
but the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something femin@@ ine about feminism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so whereas the fathers were extremely atten@@ tive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anatomy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
I &apos;m J@@ essi , and this is my suitcase .
but before I show you what I &apos;ve got inside , I &apos;m going to make a very public con@@ fes@@ sion , and that is , I &apos;m out@@ fit @-@ obsessed .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occasion .
but I don &apos;t buy anything new .
I get all my clothes secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stores .
A@@ w@@ w , thank you .
secon@@ d@@ hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wallet .
I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will I like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , I feel as though I &apos;ve won .
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED .
I mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ fits bring with her ?
so I &apos;m going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven pairs of under@@ pants and that &apos;s it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all I put in my suitcase .
I was be@@ tting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Spr@@ ings .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around TED in her under@@ wear -- that means I found a few things .
and I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ fits right now .
does that sound good ?
so as I do this , I &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , I have picked up in these advent@@ ures wearing nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with Sunday .
I call this &quot; sh@@ iny Tiger . &quot;
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week .
Monday : color is powerful .
it is almost physi@@ ologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
Tuesday : fitting in is way over@@ rated .
I &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
We@@ d@@ nes@@ day : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dress @-@ up , or that I remind them of their seven @-@ year @-@ old .
I like to smile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Th@@ urs@@ day : confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day @-@ in and day @-@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant .
and I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
Friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
and finally , Saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
so before I go home to Brooklyn , I &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
I don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , sh@@ iny out@@ fit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
think about this as a pix@@ el , a flying pix@@ el .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally , and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in For@@ mul@@ a 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a For@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmit@@ ting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actu@@ ating component .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electronics .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
just as an aside , I wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sensing and actu@@ ating is entering our everyday objects .
that &apos;s from an exhibition that Pa@@ ola Anton@@ elli is organizing at MoMA later this year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; Talk to Me . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actu@@ ator .
and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when Mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the Moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; Per@@ ch@@ รฉ non par@@ li ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and I &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
let &apos;s starting with sensing .
well , the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in Italy .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggre@@ gated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
it &apos;s when Italy won the soccer World Cup .
some of you might remember , it was Italy and France playing , and then Zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
and anyway , Italy won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river Ti@@ ber .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
you see the tim@@ eline on the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match begins -- silence .
France scores . Italy scores .
half@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
second half . end of normal time .
first over@@ time , second .
Zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
Italy wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called Cir@@ co Mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
here are the results we just ob@@ tained .
from Seattle ...
after one week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ encies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there &apos;s a lot of wasted transportation and con@@ vol@@ uted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we &apos;re throwing away , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at MIT , As@@ sa@@ f Bi@@ derman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Z@@ ar@@ ago@@ za , Spain .
it started with a question by the mayor of the city , who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pipe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ oid val@@ ves , t@@ aps , opening and closing .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pix@@ els made of water .
if those pix@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
well , we presented this to May@@ or Bel@@ loch .
he liked it very much .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the entrance of the exp@@ o .
we called it Digital W@@ ater P@@ avi@@ lion .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minim@@ ize sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , You know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They dem@@ ol@@ ished the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t dem@@ ol@@ ish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s the building working .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
well , I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from Z@@ ar@@ ago@@ za came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pix@@ els , the pix@@ els made of water , and then projections on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project I &apos;ll show you now .
that &apos;s , imagine those pix@@ els could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small helic@@ opters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pix@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synch@@ r@@ ony .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pix@@ els &apos; position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pix@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
here is the real Fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pix@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with Rob@@ er@@ to B@@ olle , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dancers -- the รฉ@@ to@@ ile at Met@@ ropolitan in New York and La S@@ cal@@ a in Mil@@ an -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Fl@@ y@@ fire .
and here you can see Rob@@ er@@ to dancing .
you see on the left the pix@@ els , the different resol@@ utions being captured .
it &apos;s both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the pix@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for Fl@@ y@@ fire .
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the London Olympics .
it &apos;s called The Cloud .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pix@@ el .
and I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digi@@ tizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self @-@ organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pix@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pix@@ els .
it &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pix@@ els .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work I &apos;m trying to artic@@ ulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s .
I was in awe .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zzy , trying to compre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snow@@ fla@@ ke on top of another snow@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s are born when they cal@@ ve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crum@@ ble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an iceberg mel@@ ts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
as the iceberg mel@@ ts , it is releasing min@@ eral @-@ rich fresh water that n@@ our@@ ishes many forms of life .
I approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s as if I &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a contin@@ uation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that &apos;s about a 15 @-@ foot boat .
and I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the water@@ line .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an average @-@ size Green@@ lan@@ dic iceberg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
I have had the distinct bl@@ essing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est I ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
temp@@ t was one of the for@@ em@@ ost gra@@ ffiti artists in the 80s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; Dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
and that was the on@@ set of ALS .
so temp@@ t is now completely paralyzed .
he only has use of his eyes .
I was exposed to him .
I have a company that does design and animation , so obviously gra@@ ffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor Tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
so I went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him And I said , &quot; Wa@@ it a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking -- don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; No , unless you &apos;re in the upper ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
has everyone seen the movie &quot; The Di@@ ving Bell and the B@@ utter@@ fly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s ar@@ cha@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
so I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no fre@@ aking idea how I was going to cash .
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I &apos;m like , &quot; All right , here &apos;s the deal : Tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it &apos;s a tra@@ ves@@ ty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
I met these guys called G@@ R@@ L , gra@@ ffiti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regis@@ ters the negative space .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was Bush s@@ lan@@ ders and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
so I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a laser and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be awesome . &quot;
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d accomplished a couple things .
one , we batter@@ ed down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine .
which was awesome .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- I call him Yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
my wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspir@@ acy theor@@ ists and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and gra@@ f on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the Ven@@ ice bo@@ ard@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the E@@ ye@@ W@@ ri@@ ter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glasses that we bought at the Ven@@ ice Beach bo@@ ard@@ walk , some copper wire and some stuff from Home De@@ pot and Radio Sh@@ ack .
we took a P@@ S@@ 3 camera , h@@ acked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; No . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big unv@@ eiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , car@@ b @-@ fest and all @-@ night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years .
I feel like I had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an Et@@ ch A sketch .
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowle@@ d@@ gment .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; Oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
Armstrong Twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in December , Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in April of this year , at the Ge@@ ffen M@@ O@@ CA in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets . &quot;
and &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad @-@ asses of the street art scene -- Bank@@ sy , She@@ par@@ d Fa@@ i@@ rey , K@@ A@@ W@@ S -- all of these guys will be there .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the E@@ ye@@ W@@ ri@@ ter -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
I &apos;m not a programmer , never done anything with o@@ cular recognition technology , but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
and I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epi@@ phan@@ ies .
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- Richard B@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in st@@ ow , Ohio where I was the class qu@@ eer .
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lo@@ unge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and I had to get out of town .
I had a thumb , I had 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- met a lover -- and back in the &apos; 80s , found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations .
about three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mrs. Pos@@ ten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .
I &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
could you please come to Ohio , and please bring that man that I know you have found by now .
and I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
we took a look at her , we laughed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hos@@ pic@@ e .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any I talked about presented itself .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; I and my partner saved hers .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
it sounds scary .
well I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in 1@@ D .
I was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
so I looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; No problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
you could see Manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns off the engines .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words I &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; br@@ ace for impact . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
I could see in her eyes , it was terror . life was over .
now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
we have this bucket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences I wanted to mend , all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did .
as I thought about that later on , I came up with a saying , which is , &quot; I collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it .
I no longer want to post@@ p@@ one anything in life .
and that ur@@ gency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge , which was by not a lot -- I thought about , wow , I really feel one real regret .
I &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried .
but in my humanity , I also allow my ego to get in .
and I regre@@ tted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as I reflected on that , I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .
the third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water coming .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Please blow up . &quot;
I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those document@@ aries .
and as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sad .
I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life .
and that sadness really fr@@ amed in one thought , which is , I only wish for one thing .
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , I was at a performance by my daughter -- first @-@ gra@@ der , not much artistic talent ...
... yet .
and I &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , I &apos;m crying , like a little kid .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
I realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad .
I was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
I was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the Stu@@ x@@ net computer worm is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to get the bomb .
their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Nat@@ anz ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment facility .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real @-@ time control systems .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t run Windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a note@@ book that is used by a maintenance engineer to con@@ figure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the plot behind Stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a Windows dro@@ pper .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gray box , dam@@ ages the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the Iranian nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
I want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on Stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dro@@ pper part , used multiple zero @-@ day vulner@@ abilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real @-@ time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stu@@ x@@ net and checked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
Stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sni@@ ffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
it &apos;s completely directed .
the dro@@ pper is pro@@ w@@ ling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
and if not , Stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a U.S. power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
so we extrac@@ ted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engineered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pper of Stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high @-@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is rocket science .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like old @-@ style assembly language .
and I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for tim@@ ers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .
so we do need target theories that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core sab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high @-@ value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the B@@ ush@@ ehr nuclear power plant and to the Nat@@ anz fuel enrich@@ ment plant .
so I told my assistant , &quot; Get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
and I ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to crack the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explode .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ epy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
I started to research scientific literature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in Nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ c@@ ade , and each cas@@ c@@ ade holds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in Iran are sub@@ divided into 15 , what is called , stages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been ob@@ tained over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually aim@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different angles .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ c@@ ade , and spinning up the ro@@ tors and slowing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and manipul@@ ating val@@ ves .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
it is Nat@@ anz , and it is only Nat@@ anz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my so@@ cks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibra@@ tion sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually pr@@ erec@@ or@@ ded by Stu@@ x@@ net .
so it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the observation camera is fed with pr@@ erec@@ or@@ ded video .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fool the oper@@ ators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to circum@@ v@@ ent a digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open relief val@@ ves within a m@@ illis@@ econd .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are com@@ promised , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can blow up .
and neither your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
think about this : this attack is generic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ f@@ ics , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
it is generic .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an att@@ acker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
they &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your target @-@ rich environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
thanks .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Ral@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite widely reported that people assume that Mos@@ sad is the main entity behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the Mos@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber super@@ power .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the United States -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for scar@@ ing the living day@@ lights out of us . thank you , Ral@@ ph .
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
I went to prison -- difficult .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , I &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
so when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of br@@ anding and sponsor@@ ship , I knew I would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , I took out an ad on eBay .
I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 TED Talk .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpor@@ ation , for @-@ profit or non @-@ profit , was going to get the once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these TED Talks ?
it &apos;s a lot .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
so even with that c@@ av@@ eat , I knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
but in the new project that I &apos;m working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
and as I said earlier , I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , I had this idea for a movie .
what I want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product plac@@ ement , marketing and advertising .
so the movie will be called &quot; The greatest movie E@@ ver sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; The greatest movie E@@ ver sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is br@@ anded from beginning to end -- from the above @-@ the @-@ title spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X@@ .
now this brand , the Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m Stadium , the stap@@ les Center ...
these people will be married to the film in perpet@@ u@@ ity -- forever .
and so the film explores this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? in perpet@@ u@@ ity , forever ?
I &apos;m a redund@@ ant person .
that was more for emphas@@ is .
it was , &quot; In perpet@@ u@@ ity . forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand X title spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the greatest car you ever drove from &quot; The greatest movie E@@ ver sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; The greatest movie E@@ ver sold . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and I would love for CE@@ G to help make it happen .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when I first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
I don &apos;t know how recep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective -- I don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ notation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1.5 million .
I think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but I think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing idi@@ ots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
J@@ K : both .
... Me@@ an@@ ing not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? I need help .
I can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
I thought &quot; Tur@@ n the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; Let &apos;s have an off @-@ the @-@ record conversation . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
I was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and I was blown away , because I thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the fr@@ actu@@ red media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz @-@ worthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what I thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal f@@ law , and that f@@ law was this .
actually no , that was not the f@@ law whatsoever .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a Google image search for transparency , this is --- This is one of the first images that comes up .
so I like the way you roll , Sergey Br@@ in . no .
this is was the problem : transparency -- free from preten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily detected or seen through ; re@@ adily understood ; character@@ ized by visi@@ bility or accessi@@ bility of information , especially concer@@ ning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our CEO &apos;s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like that odd , still @-@ screaming bear .
it &apos;s un@@ predictable -- like this odd country road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
eating an entire bowl of C@@ ool W@@ hip .
that &apos;s very risky .
now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; S@@ on , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kir@@ sh@@ en@@ baum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I &apos;d have to cut out the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
I have friends who make great big , giant Hollywood films , and I have friends who make little independent films like I make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; The greatest movie E@@ ver sold . &quot;
so how specifically will we see B@@ an in the film ?
any time I &apos;m ready to go , any time I open up my medicine cabin@@ et , you will see B@@ an de@@ od@@ or@@ ant .
while anytime I do an interview with someone , I can say , &quot; Are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
I want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous sc@@ ents .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; Par@@ adise winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- solid , roll @-@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
that &apos;s the two @-@ cent tour .
so now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five @-@ cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a chall@@ enger brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about B@@ an -- is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe B@@ an ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
superior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
we talk about bold , fresh .
I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wet@@ ness . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fresh@@ ness , more fresh@@ ness , three times fres@@ her .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi @-@ million dollar corpor@@ ation .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
I need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular Jo@@ es .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I like really nice clothes .
80 &apos;s revi@@ val meets sk@@ ater @-@ p@@ unk , unless it &apos;s laundry day .
all right , what is brand Ger@@ ry ?
unique .
I guess what kind of gen@@ re , style I am would be like dark glam@@ or .
I like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
but usually I have an access@@ ory , like sun@@ glasses , or I like crystal and things like that too .
if Dan were a brand , he might be a classic conver@@ tible Mer@@ ce@@ des B@@ enz .
the brand that I am is , I would call it cas@@ ual fly .
part hi@@ ppie , part yo@@ gi , part Brooklyn girl -- I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m the pet guy .
I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
so I guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is F@@ ed@@ Ex because I deliver the goods .
failed writer @-@ alco@@ ho@@ lic brand .
is that something ?
I &apos;m a lawyer brand .
I &apos;m Tom .
well we can &apos;t all be brand Tom , but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ ual fly .
and what I realized is I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so I found a company called Ol@@ son Z@@ alt@@ man in Pitts@@ burg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like Nest@@ le , F@@ eb@@ re@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
I did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things stem@@ med and started from one place , and for me they stem@@ med and started with my family in West Virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it &apos;s like , who do I want to be ?
I like things that are different .
I like things that are weird . I like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
what is the mach@@ ete ? what pup@@ a stage are you in now ?
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
... A little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other met@@ am@@ orph@@ oses that you &apos;ve had ?
... Do@@ esn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of ro@@ ller co@@ aster are you on ?
E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E ! no , thank you .
thanks for you patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but comple@@ mentary sides to your brand personality -- the Mor@@ gan Sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a mind@@ ful / play brand .
those are ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ ed very nicely together .
and I think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
and I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a neat thing to see .
what other brands are like that ?
the first on here is the classic , Apple .
and you can see here too , Tar@@ get , Wi@@ i , Min@@ i from the Min@@ i Co@@ op@@ ers , and Jet@@ Blue .
now there &apos;s playful brands and mind@@ ful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a playful , mind@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a playful , mind@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
are you an up attribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
or are you more of a down attribu@@ te ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more calm , reser@@ ved , conservative ?
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the fresh Prince , contemporary , advent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like Er@@ ro@@ l Fl@@ yn@@ n , nim@@ ble or agile , pro@@ fan@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , magical or my@@ s@@ tical like Gand@@ al@@ f .
or are you more of a down attribu@@ te ?
are you mind@@ ful , sophisticated like 00@@ 7 ?
are you established , traditional , nurturing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pathetic like the Oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contempl@@ ative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yo@@ da ?
over the course of this film , we had 500 @-@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to rel@@ inqu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mind@@ ful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adver@@ tis@@ er would normally never get behind .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using MRI &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commerci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
we went to San Paul@@ o where they have banned outdoor advertising .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bill@@ boards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cash @-@ str@@ apped schools all across America .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that I &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or I &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where I &apos;ve inter@@ acted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
they cut out the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; May@@ be these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
I &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film pre@@ mier@@ ed at the S@@ und@@ ance Film Festival , let &apos;s take a look .
according to Bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ mier@@ ed in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half @-@ week period .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advis@@ ed their clients not to take part .
what I always believe is that if you take chances , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
I believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure .
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk aver@@ se , then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challenged .
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them .
ultimately , moving forward , I think we have to embrace fear .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; Embr@@ ace Transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at E@@ M@@ C , who for $ 7,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on eBay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
E@@ M@@ C presents : &quot; embrace Transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
so , Mor@@ gan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,@@ 100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization , the S@@ ap@@ ling Foundation -- a check for $ 7,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s TED .
my name is A@@ mit .
and 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and I grew up in India .
I had a great education -- I &apos;m not compla@@ ining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these ar@@ twor@@ ks .
and so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
and while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
so , simple : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Proje@@ ct@@ .com.
you look around at all these museums here .
you &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ izi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the Van Go@@ gh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Met@@ ropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- Bom@@ bay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ dor .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
so now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; The Har@@ ves@@ ters &quot; by Pi@@ eter Bru@@ egel at the M@@ et .
I see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the met@@ a @-@ data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gig@@ ap@@ ix@@ el technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pix@@ els .
and I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pix@@ els ? &quot;
so I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pix@@ els .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ cel@@ ess .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
and I was like , &quot; H@@ old on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which involves beating a go@@ ose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tuesday .
and apparently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; The Star@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot;
now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see brush stro@@ kes ?
and what if you want to see how Van Go@@ gh actually created this master@@ piece ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; The Star@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of zoom -- you can just zoom around .
this is &quot; The Am@@ bassa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the National Gallery .
you can anno@@ tate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these master@@ pieces .
so I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supp@@ lement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tually excl@@ usive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .
well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and I &apos;ve never seen them .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
so I made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big close @-@ up of the little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a le@@ dge .
and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon w@@ af@@ er , and then I just cran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool @-@ shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
so quantum mechanics says that in@@ animate objects feel the same way .
the fellow passen@@ gers for in@@ animate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passen@@ gers .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down Now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we measured its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contrac@@ ting b@@ ellows .
and by giving it a gentle nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vibra@@ te and not vibra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .
so what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
now it &apos;s only at precise times when they al@@ ign .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places .
I think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness handle your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just cr@@ ammed into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weir@@ dness of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , I decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just substitu@@ te apartment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the distrac@@ tions of construction .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facili@@ tated construction rather than getting in the way .
so I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .
later I learned that at about this same time , J@@ avi@@ er and Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of reform in Hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 Hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Hon@@ dur@@ as .
at one point , J@@ avi@@ er said to Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bassy -- give some to the U.S. em@@ bassy ; give some to the Canadian em@@ bassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ bassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , Hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching constitu@@ tional crisis .
at the next regularly sched@@ ul@@ ed election , Pep@@ e L@@ obo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promised reform , but reconci@@ li@@ ation as well .
he asked Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his chief of staff .
meanwhile , I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal .
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , I tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essenti@@ als .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and distur@@ b all the existing apartment hol@@ ders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from Guatemala sent Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the TEDTalk .
he showed it to J@@ avi@@ er .
they called me .
they said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room .
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; Paul , maybe we could watch the TEDTalk . &quot;
so the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with un@@ inhab@@ ited land , a charter that speci@@ fies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
so I was asked by the president of Hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
I was asked to come to Te@@ gu@@ c@@ ig@@ al@@ p@@ a and talk again on January fourth and fifth .
so I presented another fact @-@ filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of Den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new airport that was built in Den@@ ver .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
so I was trying to persuade the Hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundred @-@ thousand acres .
everybody appl@@ au@@ ded poli@@ tely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
the leader of the con@@ gress came up on stage and said , &quot; Professor Rom@@ er , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk .
I &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
so I sat down , and they played the TEDTalk .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the North .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in Hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the en@@ for@@ cement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be en@@ forced .
and the insight of President L@@ obo was that that ass@@ ur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ cement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Hon@@ dur@@ as who had suffered for so many years from fear and dis@@ trust .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly there@@ after , on January 19th , they voted in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their constitu@@ tion to have a constitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gress in favor of this constitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
all parties , all fac@@ tions in society , backed this .
to be part of the constitu@@ tion , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
on February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
immediately after that vote , on February 21st to the 2@@ 4@@ th , a del@@ eg@@ ation of about 30 Hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is South Korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mits .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Singapore .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third .
so if you think about this practically , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ preme court be the court of final appeal for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some fin@@ ancing .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to loc@@ ate in the Americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Hon@@ dur@@ as ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about ins@@ isting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends from Hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , TED .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
and they found that the average CEO engaged in about 13@@ 9 tasks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub @-@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .
otherwise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , So for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
thank you .
so when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
it was a store called Dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ us@@ ement park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bott@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil ais@@ le .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand @-@ year @-@ old o@@ live trees .
so I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and I asked the manager , &quot; Is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
and he pointed to the bus@@ loads of tour@@ ists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
here &apos;s their jam ais@@ le .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of jam .
we set up a little ta@@ sting boo@@ th right near the entrance of the store .
we there put out six different fla@@ vors of jam or 24 different fla@@ vors of jam , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ ist@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affects us even in very con@@ sequ@@ ential decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self @-@ interests .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with G@@ ur Hu@@ ber@@ man , E@@ mir Kam@@ en@@ ica , W@@ ei J@@ ang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S.
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a retirement savings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 57 plans that ran@@ ged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
and what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
so if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid @-@ 70s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the 60@@ th perc@@ enti@@ le .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well @-@ being .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self @-@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objec@@ tively better .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy g@@ az@@ ing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ ises , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and con@@ tra@@ sting and actually picking from that stunning display .
so what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always upset when I say , &quot; C@@ ut . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous redund@@ ant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a low@@ ering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
when Pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of He@@ ad &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the Golden C@@ at Corporation got rid of their 10 worst @-@ selling cat li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and low@@ ering of costs .
you know , the average grocery store today offers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
the typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
but the nin@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ iler , the nin@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ iler in the world today is Al@@ di , and it offers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tomato sauce .
now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that David La@@ i@@ b@@ son was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard .
every single Harvard employe@@ e is now automatically en@@ rolled in a life@@ cycle fund .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
you know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
and the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
now before we started our session this afternoon , I had a ch@@ at with Gary .
and Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all @-@ expen@@ ses @-@ paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and I &apos;d like you to read it .
and now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cl@@ ap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take Gary up on his offer .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had objec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which brings me to the second technique for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ tization .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an AT@@ M card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ om@@ o Ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro Pre@@ vit@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
the third technique : categ@@ or@@ ization .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine ais@@ le .
it turns out that in Weg@@ mans grocery stores up and down the nor@@ theast cor@@ ri@@ dor , the magazine ais@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 6@@ 64 .
but you know what ?
if I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories , versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different jewelry displays .
one is called &quot; Jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is Jazz , cl@@ ap your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is swing , cl@@ ap your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly useless categ@@ or@@ ization scheme .
the categories need to say something to the cho@@ os@@ er , not the choice @-@ maker .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here &apos;s a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
car colors , exter@@ ior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 56 choices .
engines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
so now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shifts .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shifts , to 56 car colors , high choice .
what am I going to look at ?
how engaged you are .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means I &apos;m losing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
the only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is presented .
if I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
even though choosing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my prefer@@ ences for interior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
so let me rec@@ ap .
I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alternatives ; con@@ cre@@ tize -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
all of these techniques that I &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho@@ os@@ y about choosing .
and the more we &apos;re able to be cho@@ os@@ y about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
thank you very much .
Hi . I &apos;m Kevin Al@@ loc@@ ca , I &apos;m the trends manager at YouTube , and I profession@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- celebri@@ ties , singers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video up@@ loaded to YouTube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : ta@@ stema@@ kers , communities of participation and un@@ expec@@ tedness .
all right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
woo@@ o !
O@@ hh@@ hh@@ h , w@@ ow@@ ww@@ w !
last year , Be@@ ar Vas@@ quez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite National Park .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , Be@@ ar .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite Mountain Be@@ ar .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
so what happened here ?
Jimmy K@@ immel actually .
Jimmy K@@ immel posted this twe@@ et that would eventually prop@@ el the video to be as popular as it would become .
because ta@@ stema@@ kers like Jimmy K@@ immel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it &apos;s Friday , Friday . gotta get down on Friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . Friday , Friday . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on Friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Rebecca Black &apos;s &quot; Friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and similar to &quot; Dou@@ ble Rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of nowhere .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a Friday , this is true .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
but what about this day , this one particular Friday ?
well T@@ os@@ h@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
Michael J. Nelson from mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ stema@@ kers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
unlike the one @-@ way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
so &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed animation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three @-@ hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
even cats were watching this video .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this tech@@ ie , ge@@ ek@@ y Internet culture .
there were re@@ mi@@ xes .
someone made an old time@@ y version .
and then it went international .
an entire remix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
who could have predicted &quot; Dou@@ ble Rain@@ bow &quot; or Rebecca Black or &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at ? &quot;
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up@@ loaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy pro@@ testing bicycle fin@@ es in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
so I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
by being totally surprising and humor@@ ous , Casey Ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do cre@@ atively .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
O@@ hh@@ hh .
what does it mean ?
Ta@@ stema@@ kers , creative participating communities , complete un@@ expec@@ tedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popul@@ arity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Justin Bi@@ eber , got his start on YouTube .
no one has to green @-@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl hu@@ ddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
he is a poet , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine him as the commun@@ ists enter Sa@@ ig@@ on , confron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
he re@@ treated into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in v@@ ain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early dawn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
my mother , Mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had dis@@ ti@@ lled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
it was in@@ concei@@ vable to her that she would not succeed .
so after a four @-@ year sag@@ a that de@@ fies fiction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea disgu@@ ised as a fishing vessel .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
if we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
I don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ffed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
but I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Mala@@ ysi@@ an coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the rig .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in Mel@@ bour@@ ne .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
we settled in F@@ oo@@ ts@@ cra@@ y , a working @-@ class subur@@ b whose demographic is layers of immig@@ rants .
unlike the settled middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence I was obli@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of en@@ tit@@ lement in F@@ oo@@ ts@@ cra@@ y .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
and the sni@@ pp@@ ets of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
somehow she found time to study English and gain IT quali@@ fications .
we were poor .
all the dollars were al@@ located and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathematics was bu@@ dge@@ ted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
two pairs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
a school uniform down to the an@@ kles , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; sl@@ it @-@ eye &quot; and the occasion@@ al gra@@ ffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
go home to where ?
something sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will b@@ ypass you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and I slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suffered from night@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
and my job was to stay awake until her night@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and in@@ flexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ sors were sought .
centers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
in one , I was the classic Asian student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the demands that I made on myself .
in the other , I was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ ious , trag@@ ically scar@@ red by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year .
and I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
tan Le , anonymous F@@ oo@@ ts@@ cra@@ y res@@ ident , was now T@@ an Le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
I didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the c@@ ut@@ ler@@ y .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat to the routin@@ es and comfort of life in an uns@@ ung subur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ arded the boat .
no had never been an option .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the negle@@ ct of the margin@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fr@@ anch@@ ised .
and the more candi@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ tiers of possibility .
and even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not settle into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ sider , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons , can so easily mean accepting the pres@@ ump@@ tions of your prov@@ ince .
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encouraged .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able optimism , a strange mixture of humility and dar@@ ing .
so I followed my hun@@ ches .
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible challenge .
for a year we were pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess .
at the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
my hun@@ ches again .
three months later I had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the adventure has continued .
before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mat@@ tered .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and pros@@ ec@@ u@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Mel@@ bour@@ ne .
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in F@@ oo@@ ts@@ cra@@ y and sat around her cas@@ ket .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
defeat would have come too easily .
now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of en@@ tit@@ lement .
can I give them a bow in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarante@@ es nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
but if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
and also , T@@ an &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
or is it photography ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
so I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of re@@ taining the level of re@@ alism .
when I say re@@ alism , I mean photo @-@ re@@ alism .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
so I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three @-@ dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seam@@ less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
so by matching color , contrast and bri@@ gh@@ tness in the borders between the different images , adding photograph@@ ic defe@@ cts like depth of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
so here &apos;s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
the shor@@ es are from a different location .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
so to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e @-@ health projects fail .
and I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at Rad@@ b@@ oud University is we ap@@ pointed a chief listening officer .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e @-@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my Wi@@ Fi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
and every morning I hop on it .
and yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and I put my challenge on 95 kg .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sends my data through Google Health as well .
and it &apos;s collected by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need cardi@@ olog@@ ic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4,000 foll@@ owers on Twitter .
so every morning I hop on my Wi@@ Fi scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd @-@ sourcing .
and one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation controls in our car .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
we know perfectly where all the AT@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ astr@@ icht .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
but where would be the nearest A@@ ED to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the nearest life @-@ saving A@@ ED was to be ob@@ tained right now .
so what we did , we crowd@@ sour@@ ced The Netherlands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an A@@ ED , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 A@@ E@@ Ds already in The Netherlands already have been submitted .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an iPad application .
we made an application for La@@ y@@ ar , augmented reality , to find these A@@ E@@ Ds .
and whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ astr@@ icht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest A@@ ED which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ EU , which is what the product is called , but also A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ US .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crowd @-@ source all these A@@ E@@ Ds all around the world .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us vali@@ date these A@@ E@@ Ds .
these might be cou@@ rier services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ ED that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
now I work in the solar technology industry .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd @-@ sourcing .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called Code for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Peace Cor@@ ps for ge@@ eks .
we select a few f@@ ellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City Hall .
and there they make great apps , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so meet Al .
Al is a fire hydr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets sn@@ owed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we had a team of f@@ ellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program .
they were there in February , and it sn@@ owed a lot in February last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hy@@ d@@ rants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named Erik Mich@@ a@@ els @-@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ veling out side@@ walks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydr@@ ant .
so you agree to dig it out when it sn@@ ows .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the f@@ ellows wrote last year .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spreading vir@@ ally .
there &apos;s a guy in the I.@@ T. department of the City of Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out c@@ log@@ ged storm dra@@ ins .
and Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel side@@ walks when it sn@@ ows .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just fri@@ ction@@ lessly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
Pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
and that means per@@ mission@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
and that &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tac@@ kling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it &apos;s not just Code for America f@@ ellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not compla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DM@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O &apos;@@ Rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately deri@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
and like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about op@@ os@@ sums .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ os@@ sum stuck in your house .
so Scott gets this call .
he types &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for Scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the op@@ os@@ sums .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , a Web and mobile app , called C@@ iti@@ zens Conne@@ ct .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Ur@@ ban mechanics in Boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do I get this removed ? &quot;
but what happens with C@@ iti@@ zens Conne@@ ct is different .
so Scott was speaking person @-@ to @-@ person .
but on C@@ iti@@ zens Conne@@ ct everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
O@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? Y@@ ep .
turned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . walked home .
Good@@ night sweet op@@ os@@ sum . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd @-@ sourcing game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six @-@ inch layer on top .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureau@@ cracy .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ empowering ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureau@@ cracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
so that &apos;s Oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y@@ the@@ SE@@ C movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 3@@ 25 @-@ page report that &apos;s a response to the SE@@ C &apos;s request for comment on the Finan@@ cial reform Bill .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureau@@ cra@@ tically active .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our f@@ ellows is 28 , so I am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sho@@ veling out a hydr@@ ant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an op@@ os@@ sum in it .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ veling out those fire hy@@ d@@ rants all along , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question I have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
so I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
this is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
what I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RI@@ S@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi @-@ log curve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi @-@ log curves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology curves in semi @-@ log curves ?
well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi @-@ log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
but when something like this happens , things are qualit@@ atively changing .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ processor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a tax@@ i c@@ ab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and there &apos;s nothing preced@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self @-@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S @-@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
now I &apos;m an optim@@ ist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrin@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extr@@ apol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
so what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
so I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , sterile h@@ unk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of un@@ equal division of the chemicals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemicals and divided more .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expressed more .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstr@@ action .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mind@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that I did just for am@@ us@@ ement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
and I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ grams of white powder , which I try not to let the security people see at air@@ ports .
but this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ liz@@ ing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and ampli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if I had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resistance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ icillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to pen@@ icillin , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were syn@@ erg@@ istic .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi @-@ cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi @-@ cellular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neural structures .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time scales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ unting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi @-@ cellular organisms have gone through -- abstr@@ acting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele@@ phony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ apes , CD @-@ RO@@ M@@ s and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micros@@ econds .
and you saw T@@ y &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ volution program right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time scales once again .
so the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , auto@@ cataly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transis@@ tor in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what I do and what the designers at Thin@@ king Mach@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micros@@ econd time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot;
so in other words , I define what I wanted .
let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
so find the programs that come closest to sor@@ ting numbers .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of re@@ combination analog@@ ous to sex . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children inher@@ it the traits of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
so I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
score them again .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few m@@ illis@@ econds .
so I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
I was riding in a 7@@ 47 with Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . look at this .
it says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so conf@@ using .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when single @-@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi @-@ cell@@ ed organisms .
so we &apos;re the am@@ o@@ eb@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get selected out .
my story begins right here actually in Ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the star@@ ry skies with the Su@@ fi singer Mu@@ kh@@ ti@@ ar Ali .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian ep@@ ic &quot; The Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
so back in the day , when us Indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chari@@ ot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
now we do the same with airplanes .
back then , when Ar@@ j@@ una , the great Indian warrior prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
and this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techn@@ op@@ ho@@ be .
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without twe@@ eting it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
when I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
and this piece of 50 @-@ year @-@ old technology became the most magical thing to me .
it became a g@@ ild@@ ed gate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ wre@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so I felt like our cell@@ phones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so I jumped in , I jumped into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
I &apos;ve been illu@@ strating books since I was 16 .
and so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi @-@ sensor@@ ial .
but what are we doing with it ?
so I &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch K@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive app for the iPad .
so it says , &quot; Pl@@ ace your fingers upon each light . &quot;
and so -- It says , &quot; This box belongs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name .
and actually I become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and I don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and drag@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bored as children .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your iPad , take the fire@@ flies out .
and they actually illumin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single mar@@ ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I drag in to this magical device within the device .
and it opens up a map .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
this is a map that grows and gl@@ ows and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so I &apos;m just going to enter in .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary .
over here , these are the Ap@@ sar@@ as .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fai@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ ym@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the Ap@@ sar@@ as ?
these poor Ap@@ sar@@ as have been trapped inside In@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their PC@@ s , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
when I was a child , I had multiple colle@@ ctions of sticks and stones and pe@@ b@@ bles and shells .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
a child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; Oh , I saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
a child in India says , &quot; I saw a monkey today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pix@@ ies appear on a house@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ essing energy from the sun .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in j@@ ails , in prisons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low @-@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ eless@@ ness .
and being here at TED and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and I mention that because I think identity is really important .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
and I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
and so I want to talk about the power of identity .
and I didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , and that mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually ens@@ la@@ ved .
her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
when I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
and if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d ass@@ ault me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and at first I thought we were playing a game .
and I would look at her and I &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Br@@ yan . you and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
and I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; Br@@ yan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; S@@ ure . &quot;
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
and then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ yan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
well I ad@@ ored my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six @-@ pack of beer -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
and he had a si@@ p of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; Come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
and then my brother started staring at me .
he said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Oh , Mama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was devast@@ ated .
and I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broadcast bro@@ adly .
but I &apos;m 52 years old , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
when I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my male un@@ cles died of alcohol @-@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 300,000 people in j@@ ails and prisons .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
the United States now has the highest rate of incar@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ ole .
and mass incar@@ cer@@ ation , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hop@@ eless@@ ness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
in urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Bal@@ ti@@ more , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also distor@@ ted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes outcomes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
my state of Alabama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fr@@ anch@@ ises you if you have a criminal convi@@ ction .
right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fr@@ anch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting Rights Act .
and there is this stunning silence .
I represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13 @-@ year @-@ old children to die in prison .
we have life im@@ prison@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ tig@@ ation .
the only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in America is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been execu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
in avi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can ins@@ ulate ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
and it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about African American history , I tell them about slavery .
I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War II .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of rac@@ ial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and apar@@ theid .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and conflicts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconci@@ li@@ ation .
in South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apar@@ theid without a commitment to truth and reconci@@ li@@ ation .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the schol@@ ars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
he said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death penalty in Germany .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in Germany . &quot;
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an intentional and deliber@@ ate way , set about execu@@ ting people . &quot;
and I thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was execu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ proportion@@ ately Jewish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the O@@ ld South , we exec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
well I believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implic@@ ated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , those realities are shad@@ owed by suffering , abuse , degradation , margin@@ alization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advant@@ aged , those who will never get to TED .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intel@@ le@@ ct as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ eled by some convi@@ ction in our heart .
and it &apos;s that mind @-@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v H@@ av@@ el , the great C@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to excl@@ usion , to un@@ fairness , to injustice .
now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
I had the great privilege , when I was a young lawyer , of meeting Ros@@ a Parks .
and Ms. Parks used to come back to Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ nie Car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus boy@@ co@@ tt -- amazing African American woman -- and Virginia Dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , Cli@@ ff@@ ord Dur@@ r , represented Dr. King .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then Ms. Car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
and I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , M@@ a &apos;@@ am , I do . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so empowering .
and one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Br@@ yan , tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al Justice Initiative is .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and I began giving her my rap .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ ong@@ ly convicted .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimin@@ ation in the administration of criminal justice .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole sentences for children .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incar@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
I gave her my whole rap , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm mmm mmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
and that &apos;s when Ms. Car@@ r lean@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
and I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ief .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intel@@ le@@ ct and reason .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the incar@@ cer@@ ated .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get tired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and I &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sentences .
and I go to the jail and I see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but I see this kid .
and I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
yeah , Br@@ yan , the judge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
and I had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14 @-@ year @-@ old black male client like a privileged , white 75 @-@ year @-@ old corporate executive . &quot;
and I put in my motion that there was pros@@ ec@@ u@@ torial mis@@ conduct and police mis@@ conduct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ conduct .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduct .
and the next morning , I woke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and I had just forgotten all about it .
and I finally decided , oh gosh , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thouse .
and I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thouse .
and as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thouse , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ itor in this cour@@ thouse .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; You &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ gged me .
and he whis@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and I have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
and as soon as I walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I did . &quot; and we started arguing .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tr@@ aged .
I had written these crazy things .
and police officers were coming in and assistant pros@@ ec@@ u@@ tors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
and before I knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
and out of the corner of my eye , I could see this jan@@ itor pac@@ ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holl@@ er .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at co@@ uns@@ el table .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that the jan@@ itor had come into court .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; Jimmy , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
for example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all hom@@ icide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and this refer@@ end@@ um would propose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ cement and safety .
and I think that opportunity exists all around us .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incar@@ cer@@ ation rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
the great increase in mass incar@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and we got carried away with the rhetor@@ ic of punishment .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low @-@ level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ timi@@ zed .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are vic@@ timi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
Br@@ yan , you &apos;ve struck a massive ch@@ ord here .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to TED . thank you .
threats , in the wake of Bin Laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .

crisis . death . disaster .
Oh , my God .
so those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media prefer@@ enti@@ ally feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the temporal lobe called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
it sorts and s@@ cour@@ s through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
so given a dozen news stories , we will prefer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; If it ble@@ eds it leads , &quot; is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimis@@ tic .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now I &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we surely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adju@@ sted for infl@@ ation around the world has tri@@ pled .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,000 @-@ fold .
Steve Pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
and Charles K@@ enny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
think of this , in America today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refriger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dreamed of such lux@@ uries .
under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
my good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on Moore &apos;s Law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law over the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it &apos;s plo@@ tted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , riding on Moore &apos;s Law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at Auto@@ desk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3D printing , which is the ability to democra@@ tize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanom@@ ateri@@ als ; and A@@ .@@ I.
I mean , how many of you saw the winning of Je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by IBM &apos;s Watson ?
I mean , that was ep@@ ic .
in fact , I sc@@ ou@@ red the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could .
and I love this : &quot; Watson Van@@ qu@@ ishes Human oppon@@ ents . &quot;
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
and imagine if you would A@@ .@@ I. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
four years ago here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Sing@@ ul@@ arity University .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have sounded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
when I think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
you see , scar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource @-@ liber@@ ating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of N@@ apol@@ e@@ on I@@ II in the mid @-@ 180@@ 0s .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
he invited over to dinner the king of Si@@ am .
all of N@@ apol@@ e@@ on &apos;s troops were fed with silver u@@ ten@@ sil@@ s , N@@ apol@@ e@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ sil@@ s .
but the King of Si@@ am , he was fed with aluminum u@@ ten@@ sil@@ s .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the Washington Mon@@ um@@ ent is made of aluminum .
you see , even though aluminum is 8.@@ 3 percent of the Earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silic@@ ates .
but then the technology of electro@@ l@@ ys@@ is came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw @-@ away ment@@ ality .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
we think about energy scar@@ city .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bath@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ watts of energy hits the Earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of solar @-@ generated electricity is 50 percent that of dies@@ el @-@ generated electricity in India -- 8.@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the United States , solar electricity will be six cents a kil@@ ow@@ att hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when Carl S@@ agan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Saturn ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a P@@ ale Blue D@@ ot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanom@@ ateri@@ als .
and the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning , one of the great DI@@ Y innovators , I &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room refriger@@ ator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- sal@@ t@@ water , poll@@ uted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two cents a li@@ ter .
the ch@@ air@@ man of Coca @-@ Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
and if that p@@ ans out , which I have every confidence it will , Coca @-@ Cola will deploy this globally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
my goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penet@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
think about it , that a Mas@@ ai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile com@@ m than President Reagan did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
better than that , the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS , HD video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ alizing and demon@@ e@@ tizing into your cellphone .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
last month , I had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m Foundation something called the $ 10 million Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der X Prize .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got A@@ .@@ I. , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board @-@ certified doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the C@@ DC and prev@@ ents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
I call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on Earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion Internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
and rather than having economic sh@@ ut@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars inje@@ cted into the global economy .
and they will get healthier by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the Khan Academy , and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the oppres@@ sed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
the one thing I &apos;ve learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called Fol@@ dit .
it came out of the University of Washington in Seattle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it folds dic@@ t@@ ates its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an MIT professor , it wasn &apos;t a Cal@@ Tech student , it was a person from England , from Manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a re@@ hab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of the DI@@ Y innov@@ ator .
we have the capital of the techn@@ o @-@ philanthrop@@ ist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and I think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false pres@@ tige to be able to do that .
before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
Hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World S@@ eries .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; Mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a b@@ atter who bats 300 .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in Maj@@ or League Baseball ?
good , really good , maybe an all @-@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hit@@ ter ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
legen@@ dary -- as in Ted Williams legen@@ dary -- the last Maj@@ or League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ ies and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a cardi@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on angi@@ op@@ las@@ ties .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the com@@ eb@@ ack tra@@ il .
and she &apos;s hitting a 25@@ 7 .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
but I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an orth@@ opedi@@ c surgeon , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a param@@ edi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or param@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school .
I was an obs@@ essive comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that Brian Gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
and so I did .
and I studied in my little Gar@@ ret at the nurses &apos; res@@ iden@@ ce at Toronto General Hospital , not far from here .
and I memor@@ ized everything .
I memor@@ ized in my anatomy class the origins and exer@@ tions of every muscle , every branch of every arter@@ y that came off the aor@@ ta , differenti@@ al diagnos@@ es ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
I even knew the differenti@@ al diagnosis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ b@@ ular ac@@ id@@ osis .
and all the while , I was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge .
and I did well , I graduated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
and I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memor@@ ized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immun@@ ize me against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. Drucker .
I was a res@@ ident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working .
at the time I was assigned to the cardi@@ ology service on a cardi@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardi@@ ology cons@@ ult , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
and I saw Mrs. Drucker , and she was breath@@ less .
and when I listened to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
and when I listened to her chest with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope , I could hear cr@@ ack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have short@@ ness of breath .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
I made it and I set to work treating her .
I gave her as@@ pir@@ in . I gave her medications to rel@@ ieve the stra@@ in on her heart .
I gave her medications that we call di@@ ure@@ tics , water pills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access fluid .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and I felt really good .
and that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ nish additional information about her .
maybe I did it for a good reason .
maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high @-@ maintenance res@@ ident .
maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that I made was worse .
in sending her home , I dis@@ reg@@ arded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , so l@@ acking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said very matter @-@ of @-@ fac@@ tly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
so I signed the dis@@ charge papers , and an ambul@@ ance came , param@@ e@@ dic@@ s came to take her home .
and I went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stomach .
but I carried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dre@@ ad .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nurse asked matter @-@ of @-@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the param@@ e@@ dic@@ s brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
and the emerg@@ . staff pulled out all the stops .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a ventil@@ ator .
and I was shocked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and I went through this ro@@ ller co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the intensive care unit , and I hoped against hope that she would recover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had irre@@ versi@@ ble brain damage .
and the family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ igned themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be acqu@@ ain@@ ted with that .
over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend confron@@ ts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gu@@ ides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the un@@ healthy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what I was feeling .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
he talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ oth@@ ed things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
and I kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t I ask my atten@@ ding ? why did I send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did I make such a stupid mistake ?
why did I go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it lifted .
I began to feel a bit better .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again .
and I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I re@@ double my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and I went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later I was an atten@@ ding in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto , and I saw a 25 year @-@ old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
it was busy , I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
he kept pointing here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit pink .
and I gave him a prescription for pen@@ icillin and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his thro@@ at .
and two days later I came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
he had a potentially life @-@ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lo@@ t@@ ti@@ tis .
you can Google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
and I went through the same period of shame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emergency shift , I missed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
one I thought had a kidney stone .
I ordered a kidney X @-@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a re@@ assessment of the patient noticed some ten@@ derness in the right lower quad@@ rant and called the surgeons .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
I ordered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ d@@ rate him and asked my colleague to reass@@ ess him .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ derness in the right lower quad@@ rant , called the surgeons .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
and I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B@@ .S.
some of my do@@ ozi@@ es have been in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and un@@ supported .
here &apos;s the problem : if I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still @-@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
how can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orth@@ opedi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep de@@ priv@@ ation and those who can , those who have l@@ ousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ casting and journalism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical errors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show &quot; White coat , Black Art . &quot;
and what I &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dos@@ age , where hospital @-@ acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing ha@@ voc and death .
in this country , as many as 2@@ 4,000 Can@@ adi@@ ans die of preventable medical errors .
in the United States , the Institute of Medicine pe@@ gged it at 100,000 .
in both cases , these are gross under@@ estimates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
and here &apos;s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sleep de@@ priv@@ ation is absolutely pervasive .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive biases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ r@@ ulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
so if you take the system , as I was taught , and weed out all the error @-@ pr@@ one health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on &quot; White coat , Black Art , &quot; I made it a habit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from param@@ e@@ dic@@ s to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the microphone towards them .
and their pup@@ ils would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and sw@@ allow hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
the re@@ defined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a go@@ t@@ ch@@ a way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowle@@ dges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is evolving to create back@@ ups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fos@@ ters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewar@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewar@@ ded for coming clean .
my name is Brian Gold@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physician .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shifting baseline .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
he was actually collecting fish .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
this was the sail@@ fin grou@@ per .
a big fisher@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
now the fish is on the I@@ UC@@ N Red L@@ ist .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to Galapagos .
we still think it is pristine .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ touched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting wa@@ ist@@ line .
because I was there in &apos; 71 , studying a lag@@ oon in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
and I thought I could bl@@ end in .
and I got a big sun@@ burn , and I was convinced that I was really not from there .
this was my first sun@@ burn .
and the lag@@ oon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ grove .
and it had til@@ ap@@ ia about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of til@@ ap@@ ia called black@@ chin til@@ ap@@ ia .
and the fisheries for this til@@ ap@@ ia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana .
when I went there 27 years later , the fish had shr@@ unk to half of their size .
they were mat@@ uring at five centi@@ meters .
they had been pushed genetically .
there were still f@@ ishes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that I was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introduction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ theast Asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant im@@ posing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ hers And this boat , quite ugly , is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ara 4 .
and I went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the J@@ ava Sea .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
what we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ ddy mess .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not drow@@ ned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of debris is actually collected by fis@@ hers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been f@@ ished .
but it &apos;s not documented .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : biodiversity , numbers of Or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extr@@ apol@@ ate forward .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
at the end you want to sustain miserable le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become rar@@ er because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
for example , the anec@@ dote that some present , as Cap@@ tain so @-@ and @-@ so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utiliz@@ ed by fisher@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
because with marine protected areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot concei@@ ve because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to res@@ et their baseline .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
there I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
this is a simulation of Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ ake Bay .
there were gray whales in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ e@@ ake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; Avat@@ ar . &quot;
and if you think about &quot; Avat@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the P@@ oc@@ ah@@ ont@@ as story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
because it ev@@ okes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my recom@@ mend@@ ation , it &apos;s the only one I will provide , is for Cameron to do &quot; Avat@@ ar II &quot; underwater .
thank you very much .
in the 1980s in the commun@@ ist Eastern Germany , if you owned a type@@ writer , you had to register it with the government .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the type@@ writer .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ackers .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
like here , we have Mr. Dimit@@ ry Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ ev in Ukra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of million@@ air@@ es online , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attacks .
here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mir T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form Tar@@ tu in Est@@ onia .
this is Alfred Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
this is Stephen Watt .
this is B@@ j@@ orn S@@ und@@ in .
this is Matthew Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al @-@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking tro@@ j@@ ans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
the U.S. Secre@@ t Service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of att@@ ackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by pro@@ tests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laugh@@ s .
groups like Anony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main att@@ ackers : criminals who do it for the money , h@@ ack@@ tiv@@ ists like Anony@@ mous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in Dig@@ i@@ Not@@ ar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Dig@@ i@@ Not@@ ar is a certi@@ fic@@ ate Auth@@ ority from The Netherlands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
somebody broke in and they h@@ acked it thor@@ ough@@ ly .
and I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government represent@@ atives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plau@@ sible that people died because of the Dig@@ i@@ Not@@ ar hack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
well Dig@@ i@@ Not@@ ar is a C@@ .A.
they sell certi@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with certi@@ fic@@ ates ?
well you need a certi@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has htt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cryp@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in to@@ tal@@ itarian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more trust@@ worthy than the local services and they are en@@ cryp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t Sno@@ op on their discussions .
except they can if they hack into a foreign C@@ .A.
and issue ro@@ gue certi@@ fic@@ ates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of Dig@@ i@@ Not@@ ar .
what about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
well in Egypt , the ri@@ o@@ ters loo@@ ted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of papers .
among those papers , was this bin@@ der en@@ titled &quot; F@@ IN@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot;
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 80,000 Euro@@ s to the Egyptian government .
the company headquarters are right here .
so Western governments are providing to@@ tal@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so @-@ called State Tro@@ jan was found , which was a Tro@@ jan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your Internet connection .
they will even use tools like State Tro@@ jan to infe@@ ct your computer with a Tro@@ jan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your pass@@ words .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
why should I worry ?
because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy is imp@@ lied .
privacy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 18@@ 68 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ules made of cement of a fixed measure@@ ment that fit together .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most @-@ used construction unit in the world .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , LE@@ G@@ O came up with this .
it was called the Autom@@ atic Bin@@ ding brick .
and in a few short years , LE@@ G@@ O bri@@ cks took place in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
Lego made it accessible .
Lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
meanwhile the exact same year , at Bell Lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
the transis@@ tor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transis@@ tor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transis@@ tor was only for experts .
I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so I decided to change that .
eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago I started developing li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits .
let me show you how they work .
Lit@@ t@@ le@@ Bits are electronic mod@@ ules with each one specific function .
they &apos;re pre @-@ engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part about it is they sn@@ ap together with mag@@ nets .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the bri@@ cks are color @-@ coded .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is sn@@ ap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pulse mo@@ dule , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready @-@ to @-@ use brick .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
for example , how a night@@ light works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an iPod respon@@ ds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits to design schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have Geor@@ die making ...
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a motion @-@ activated conf@@ et@@ ti can@@ on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of play@@ dough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
to these non @-@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ le@@ Bits is open @-@ source .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inventing .
thank you .
